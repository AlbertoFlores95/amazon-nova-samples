    "# Long Context Instruction Following and Understanding with Amazon Nova Premier\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths, particularly up to 1 million tokens, represent a significant advancement in natural language processing, enabling the handling of vast amounts of information in a single input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This large context enables and simplifies cases requiring extended context lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use long context with up to 1M context window for Amazon Nova Premier, by analysing Amazon Financial Reports over multiple years in one request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When is long context useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document Processing and Summarization:** LLMs can analyze and summarize extensive documents, such as legal contracts, regulatory texts, or academic papers. For instance, law firms can use these models to reduce manual review time, minimizing the risk of overlooking critical information, while banks can process lengthy regulatory documents for compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enhanced Conversation Memory:** In customer service and chat applications, a 1 million token context enables LLMs to retain extensive conversation histories, improving coherence and relevance. This is particularly beneficial for handling long chat threads or email exchanges, enhancing user satisfaction by ensuring the model remembers previous interactions. For example, chatbots can maintain context over hours of dialogue, a significant improvement over models with shorter memory spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complex Task Handling:** Tasks requiring long-term planning or integration of multiple data sources benefit from extended contexts. This includes academic research, where LLMs can summarize large volumes of literature and generate hypotheses, and financial analysis, where they can process complex datasets for decision-making. Additionally, LLMs can manage large codebases, supporting developers in debugging or generating code for projects with over 30,000 lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through a simple financial document analyser:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download financial documents over multiple years\n",
    "* Stack the PDF documents as part of the prompt.\n",
    "* Request analysis over time for these reports to get insights on trends.\n",
    "* Show the results"
