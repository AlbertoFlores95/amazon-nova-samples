    "Chain of thought prompting is a technique used with AI language models that encourages them to solve problems by showing their reasoning process step by step, rather than jumping straight to an answer. By asking the AI to \"think step-by-step\" or to \"DO NOT provide answer without thinking step by step\" the model often produces more accurate and reliable results. This approach works similarly to how a teacher might ask a student to show their work when solving a math problem, allowing both the AI and the person interacting with it to follow the reasoning that led to the conclusion.\n",

       "Alright, let's tackle this jug problem. So, we have three jugs: an 8-unit jug that's full, and two empty 5-unit jugs. The goal is to get both 5-unit jugs to have 4 units each, with the 8-unit jug empty. Each pour stops when the source is empty or the destination is full. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n",

       "Starting with A=8, B=0, C=0. The possible moves are pouring from A to B or C. Since B and C are both 5, pouring from A (which has 8) into B would fill B up to 5, leaving A with 3. So after that, we have A=3, B=5, C=0. Alternatively, pouring into C would do the same: A=3, B=0, C=5. Either way, we end up with 3 in A and 5 in one of the others. Let's try pouring into B first.\n",

So after that, A=3, B=0, C=5. Hmm, but then we need to get 4 into both B and C. Maybe we can pour from C into A? Let's see.\n",

       "If we pour from C (5) into A (3), which can hold up to 8. So pouring 5 into A would make A=8, C=0. Then we're back to the original state except B is 0. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe pour from B into C first. Wait, but B is empty now. Wait, maybe another approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, maybe after step 1: A=3, B=5, C=0. Then pour from B into C. So B=0, C=5. Then pour from A (3) into B. So A=0, B=3, C=5. Now, we need to get 4 into B and C. So B has 3, C has 5. If we pour from C into B, since B can take 2 more. So pour 2 from C to B. Then B=5, C=3. Now, A=0, B=5, C=3. Then pour from B into A. A can take 5, so A=5, B=0, C=3. Then pour from C (3) into B. B=3, C=0. Then pour from A (5) into C. C=5, A=0. Then pour from C (5) into B. B=5, C=0. Hmm, this seems like a loop. Maybe not the right path.\n",
