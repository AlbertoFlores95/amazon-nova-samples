    "Chain of thought prompting is a technique used with Large Language Models (LLMs) that encourages them to solve problems by showing their reasoning process step by step, rather than jumping straight to an answer. By asking the model to \"think step-by-step\" or to \"DO NOT provide answer without thinking step by step\" the model often produces more accurate and reliable results. This approach works similarly to how a teacher might ask a student to show their work when solving a math problem, allowing both the model and the person interacting with it to follow the reasoning that led to the conclusion.\n",
