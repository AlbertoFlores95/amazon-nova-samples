{"prompt": "You are an expert research assistant. Here is a document you will answer questions about:\n\nTo our shareowners:\nIm so proud of what all the teams here at Amazon have accomplished on behalf of customers this past year.\nAmazonians around the world are polishing products and services to a degree that is beyond what’s expected or\nrequired, taking the long view, reinventing normal, and getting customers to say Wow.\nI’d like to take you on a tour that samples a small subset of our various initiatives, ranging from Prime to\nAmazon Smile to Mayday. The goal is to give you a sense for how much is going on across Amazon and how\nexciting it is to work on these programs. This broad array of initiatives is only possible because a large team of\ntalented people at every level are exercising their good judgment every day and always asking, how do we make\nthis better?\nOk, let’s get started on the tour.\nPrime\nCustomers love Prime. More than one million customers joined Prime in the third week of December alone,\nand there are now tens of millions of Prime members worldwide. On a per customer basis, Prime members are\nordering more items, across more categories, than ever before. Even internally, it’s easy for us to forget that\nPrime was a new, unproven (some even said foolhardy) concept when we launched it nine years ago: all-you-\ncan-eat, two-day shipping for a flat annual fee. At that time, we had one million eligible Prime products. This\nyear, we passed 20 million eligible products, and we continue to add more. We’ve made Prime better in other\nways too, adding new digital benefits – including the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library and Prime Instant Video.\nAnd we’re not done. We have many ideas for how to make Prime even better.\nReaders & Authors\nWe’re investing heavily on behalf of readers. The all-new, high-resolution, high-contrast Kindle Paperwhite\nlaunched to rave reviews. We integrated the very impressive Goodreads into Kindle, introduced FreeTime for\nKindle, and launched Kindle in India, Mexico, and Australia. Bringing joy to air travelers, the FAA approved the\nuse of electronic devices during takeoff and landing. Our public policy team, with the help of many allies,\nworked patiently for four years on this, at one point loading a test plane with 150 active Kindles. Yes, it all\nworked fine!\nJoining CreateSpace, Kindle Singles, and Kindle Direct Publishing, is the new service Kindle Worlds, the\nliterary journal Day One, eight new Amazon Publishing imprints, and the launch of Amazon Publishing in the\nUK and Germany. Thousands of authors are already using these services to build fulfilling writing careers. Many\nwrite and tell us how we have helped them send their children to college, pay off medical bills, or purchase a\nhome. We are missionaries for reading and these stories inspire and encourage us to keep inventing on behalf of\nwriters and readers.\nPrime Instant Video\nPrime Instant Video is experiencing tremendous growth across all metrics – including new customers,\nrepeat usage, and total number of streams. These are output metrics and they suggest we are on a good path,\nfocusing on the right inputs. Two of the key inputs are the growth of selection and the desirability of that\nselection. Since we launched PIV in 2011 with 5,000 titles, we’ve grown selection to more than 40,000 movies\nand TV episodes – all included in your Prime membership. PIV has exclusives on hundreds of sought after TV\nseasons including Downton Abbey, the ratings blockbuster Under the Dome, The Americans, Justified, Grimm,\nOrphan Black, Suits, and kids programs such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and Blue’s Clues.\nIn addition, our Amazon Studios team continues to invest heavily in original content. Garry Trudeau’s Alpha\nHouse, starring John Goodman, debuted last year and quickly became the most-watched show on Amazon. We\nrecently greenlit six more originals, including Bosch, by Michael Connelly, The After, from Chris Carter of The\nX-Files, Mozart in the Jungle, from Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, and Jill Soloway’s beautiful\nTransparent, which some have called the best pilot in years. We like our approach and are replicating it with our\nrecent rollout of PIV in both the UK and Germany. The early customer response in those countries has been\nterrific, surpassing our expectations.\nFire TV\nJust this past week, after two years of hard work, our hardware team launched Fire TV. Not only is Fire TV\nthe best way to watch Amazon’s video offerings, it also embraces non-Amazon content services like Netflix,\nHulu Plus, VEVO, WatchESPN, and many more. Fire TV has big hardware specs in a category that’s previously\nbeen hardware-light. It shows. Fire TV is fast and fluid. And our ASAP technology predicts what you might want\nto watch and pre-buffers it, so shows start instantly. Our team also put a small microphone in the remote control.\nHold down the mic button on the remote, and you can speak your search term rather than type it into an alphabet\ngrid. The team has done a terrific job – the voice search actually works.\nIn addition to Prime Instant Video, Fire TV gives you instant access to over 200,000 movies and TV\nepisodes available a la carte, including new releases like Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, Dallas Buyers Club, Frozen,\nand more. As a bonus, Fire TV also lets you play high-quality, inexpensive games on your living room TV. We\nhope you try it out. If you do, let us know what you think. The team would love to hear your feedback.\nAmazon Game Studios\nIt’s early in the twenty-second century and Earth is threatened by an alien species, the Ne’ahtu.\nThe aliens infected Earth’s energy grid with a computer virus to disable the planet’s defenses.\nBefore they could strike, computer science prodigy Amy Ramanujan neutralized the alien virus\nand saved the planet. Now, the Ne’ahtu are back and Dr. Ramanujan must prevent them from\nlaunching an all-out invasion on Earth. She needs your help.\nThat’s how Sev Zero, the first Fire TV exclusive from Amazon Game Studios, begins. The team combined\ntower defense with shooter gameplay and created a co-op mode where one player leads on the ground with their\ngamepad controller while a second player provides air support from a tablet. I can assure you that there are some\nintense moments when you’ll appreciate a well-timed air-strike. When you see it, you may be surprised that this\nlevel of game play is possible on an inexpensive streaming media device. Sev Zero is only the first of a collection\nof innovative and graphically beautiful games we’re building from the ground up for Fire tablets and Fire TV.\nAmazon Appstore\nThe Amazon Appstore now serves customers in almost 200 countries. Selection has grown to include over\n200,000 apps and games from top developers around the globe – nearly tripling in size over the past year. We\nintroduced Amazon Coins, a virtual currency that saves customers up to 10% on app and in-app purchases. Our\nWhispersync for Games technology lets you start a game on one device and continue it on another without losing\nyour progress. Developers can use the Mobile Associates program to offer millions of physical products from\nAmazon inside their apps, and earn referral fees when customers buy those items. We introduced Appstore\nDeveloper Select, a marketing program that promotes new apps and games on Kindle Fire tablets and on\nAmazon’s Mobile Ad Network. We created Analytics and A/B Testing services – free services that empower\ndevelopers to track user engagement and optimize their apps for iOS, Android, and Fire OS. Also this year, we\nembraced HTML5 web app developers. They too can now offer their apps on Kindle Fire and through the\nAmazon Appstore.\nSpoken Word Audio\n2013 was a landmark year for Audible, the world’s largest seller and producer of audiobooks. Audible\nmakes it possible for you to read when your eyes are busy. Millions of customers download hundreds of millions\nof audiobooks and other spoken-word programming from Audible. Audible customers downloaded close to\n600 million listening hours in 2013. Thanks to Audible Studios, people drive to work listening to Kate Winslet,\nColin Firth, Anne Hathaway, and many other stars. One big hit in 2013 was Jake Gyllenhaal’s performance of\nThe Great Gatsby, which has already sold 100,000 copies. Whispersync for Voice allows customers to switch\nseamlessly back and forth between reading a book on their Kindle and listening to the corresponding Audible\nbook on their smart phone. The Wall Street Journal called Whispersync for Voice “Amazon’s new killer app for\nbooks.” If you haven’t already, I recommend you give it a try – it’s fun and expands the amount of time you have\navailable to read.\nFresh Grocery\nAfter trialing the service for five years in Seattle (no one accuses us of a lack of patience), we expanded\nAmazon Fresh to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Prime Fresh members pay $299 a year and receive same-day\nand early morning delivery not only on fresh grocery items but also on over 500,000 other items ranging from\ntoys to electronics to household goods. We’re also partnering with favorite local merchants (the Cheese Store of\nBeverly Hills, Pike Place Fish Market, San Francisco Wine Trading Company, and many more) to provide the\nsame convenient home delivery on a great selection of prepared foods and specialty items. We’ll continue our\nmethodical approach – measuring and refining Amazon Fresh – with the goal of bringing this incredible service\nto more cities over time.\nAmazon Web Services\nAWS is eight years old, and the team’s pace of innovation is actually accelerating. In 2010, we launched 61\nsignificant services and features. In 2011, that number was 82. In 2012, it was 159. In 2013: 280. We’re also\nexpanding our geographic footprint. We now have 10 AWS regions around the world, including the East Coast of\nthe U.S., two on the West Coast, Europe, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Brazil, China, and a government-only\nregion called GovCloud. We have 26 availability zones across regions and 51 edge locations for our content\ndistribution network. The development teams work directly with customers and are empowered to design, build,\nand launch based on what they learn. We iterate continuously, and when a feature or enhancement is ready, we\npush it out and make it instantly available to all. This approach is fast, customer-centric, and efficient – it’s\nallowed us to reduce prices more than 40 times in the past 8 years – and the teams have no plans to slow down.\nEmployee Empowerment\nWe challenge ourselves to not only invent outward facing features, but also to find better ways to do things\ninternally – things that will both make us more effective and benefit our thousands of employees around the\nworld.\nCareer Choice is a program where we pre-pay 95% of tuition for our employees to take courses for in-\ndemand fields, such as airplane mechanic or nursing, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at\nAmazon. The goal is to enable choice. We know that for some of our fulfillment center employees, Amazon will\nbe a career. For others, Amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job somewhere else – a job that may\nrequire new skills. If the right training can make the difference, we want to help.\nThe second program is called Pay to Quit. It was invented by the clever people at Zappos, and the Amazon\nfulfillment centers have been iterating on it. Pay to Quit is pretty simple. Once a year, we offer to pay our\nassociates to quit. The first year the offer is made, it’s for $2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year\nuntil it reaches $5,000. The headline on the offer is “Please Don’t Take This Offer.” We hope they don’t take the\noffer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and\nthink about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don’t want to be isn’t\nhealthy for the employee or the company.\nA third inward innovation is our Virtual Contact Center. It’s an idea we started a few years back and have\ncontinued to grow with terrific results. Under this program, employees provide customer service support for\nAmazon and Kindle customers while working from home. This flexibility is ideal for many employees who,\nperhaps because they have young children or for another reason, either cannot or prefer not to work outside the\nhome. Our Virtual Contact Center is our fastest growing “site” in the U.S., operating in more than ten states\ntoday. This growth will continue as we hope to double our state footprint in 2014.\nVeteran Hiring\nWe seek leaders who can invent, think big, have a bias for action, and deliver results on behalf of customers.\nThese principles look familiar to men and women who’ve served our country in the armed forces, and we find\nthat their experience leading people is invaluable in our fast-paced work environment. We’re a member of\nJoining Forces and the 100,000 Jobs Mission – two national efforts that encourage businesses to offer service\nmembers and their families career opportunities and support. Our Military Talent team attended more than 50\nrecruiting events last year to help veterans find job opportunities at Amazon. In 2013, we hired more than 1,900\nveterans. And once veterans join our team, we offer several programs that help them transition more easily into\nthe civilian workforce and that connect them with our internal network of veterans for mentoring and support.\nThese programs have earned us recognition as a top employer by G.I. Jobs Magazine, U.S. Veterans Magazine,\nand Military Spouse Magazine, and we’ll continue to invest in military veteran hiring as we grow.\nFulfillment Innovation\nNineteen years ago, I drove the Amazon packages to the post office every evening in the back of my Chevy\nBlazer. My vision extended so far that I dreamed we might one day get a forklift. Fast-forward to today and we\nhave 96 fulfillment centers and are on our 7th generation of fulfillment center design. Our operations team is\nextraordinary – methodical and ingenious. Through our Kaizen program, named for the Japanese term “change\nfor the better,” employees work in small teams to streamline processes and reduce defects and waste. Our Earth\nKaizens set energy reduction, recycling, and other green goals. In 2013, more than 4,700 associates participated\nin 1,100 Kaizens.\nSophisticated software is key in our FCs. This year, we rolled out 280 major software improvements across\nthe FC network. Our goal is to continue to iterate and improve on the design, layout, technology, and operations\nin these buildings, ensuring that each new facility we build is better than the last. I invite you to come see one for\nyourself. We offer fulfillment center tours open to the public, ages six and above. You can find info on the\navailable tours at www.amazon.com/fctours. I’m always amazed when I visit one of our FCs, and I hope you’ll\narrange a tour. I think you’ll be impressed.\nUrban Campus\nIn 2013, we added 420,000 square feet of new headquarters space in Seattle and broke ground on what will\nbecome four city blocks and several million square feet of new construction. It is a fact that we could have saved\nmoney by instead building in the suburbs, but for us, it was important to stay in the city. Urban campuses are\nmuch greener. Our employees are able to take advantage of existing communities and public transit\ninfrastructure, with less dependence on cars. We’re investing in dedicated bike lanes to provide safe, pollution-\nfree, easy access to our offices. Many of our employees can live nearby, skip the commute altogether, and walk\nto work. Though I can’t prove it, I also believe an urban headquarters will help keep Amazon vibrant, attract the\nright talent, and be great for the health and wellbeing of our employees and the city of Seattle.\nFast Delivery\nIn partnership with the United States Postal Service, we’ve begun for the first time to offer Sunday delivery\nto select cities. Sunday delivery is a win for Amazon customers, and we plan to roll it out to a large portion of the\nU.S. population throughout 2014. We’ve created our own fast, last-mile delivery networks in the UK where\ncommercial carriers couldn’t support our peak volumes. In India and China, where delivery infrastructure isn’t\nyet mature, you can see Amazon bike couriers delivering packages throughout the major cities. And there is more\ninvention to come. The Prime Air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles, and we\nare in the design phase on generations 7 and 8.\nExperiments and More Experiments\nWe have our own internal experimentation platform called “Weblab” that we use to evaluate improvements\nto our websites and products. In 2013, we ran 1,976 Weblabs worldwide, up from 1,092 in 2012, and 546 in\n2011. One recent success is our new feature called “Ask an owner”. It was many years ago that we pioneered the\nidea of online customer reviews – customers sharing their opinion on a product to help other customers make an\ninformed purchase decision. “Ask” is in that same tradition. From a product page, customers can ask any\nquestion related to the product. Is the product compatible with my TV/Stereo/PC? Is it easy to assemble? How\nlong does the battery last? We then route these questions to owners of the product. As is the case with reviews,\ncustomers are happy to share their knowledge to directly help other customers. Millions of questions have\nalready been asked and answered.\nApparel and Shoes\nAmazon Fashion is booming. Premium brands are recognizing that they can use Amazon to reach fashion-\nconscious, high-demo customers, and customers are enjoying the selection, free returns, detailed photos, and\nvideo clips that let them see how clothes move and drape as the models walk and turn. We opened a new 40,000\nsquare foot photo studio in Brooklyn and now shoot an average of 10,413 photos every day in the studio’s\n28 bays. To celebrate the opening, we hosted a design contest with students from Pratt, Parsons, School of Visual\nArts, and the Fashion Institute of Technology that was judged by a panel of industry leaders including Steven\nKolb, Eva Chen, Derek Lam, Tracy Reese, and Steven Alan. Kudos to Parsons who took home the top prize.\nFrustration-Free Packaging\nOur battle against annoying wire ties and plastic clamshells rages on. An initiative that began five years ago\nwith a simple idea that you shouldn’t have to risk bodily injury opening your new electronics or toys, has now\ngrown to over 200,000 products, all available in easy-to-open, recyclable packaging designed to alleviate “wrap\nrage” and help the planet by reducing packaging waste. We have over 2,000 manufacturers in our Frustration-\nFree Packaging program, including Fisher-Price, Mattel, Unilever, Belkin, Victorinox Swiss Army, Logitech, and\nmany more. We’ve now shipped many millions of Frustration-Free items to 175 countries. We are also reducing\nwaste for customers – eliminating 33 million pounds of excess packaging to date. This program is a perfect\nexample of a missionary team staying heads-down focused on serving customers. Through hard work and\nperseverance, an idea that started with only 19 products is now available on hundreds of thousands and benefiting\nmillions of customers.\nFulfillment by Amazon\nThe number of sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon grew more than 65% last year. Growth like that at such\nlarge scale is unusual. FBA is unique in many ways. It’s not often you get to delight two customer sets with one\nprogram. With FBA, sellers can store their products in our fulfillment centers, and we pick, pack, ship, and\nprovide customer service for these products. Sellers benefit from one of the most advanced fulfillment networks\nin the world, easily scaling their businesses to reach millions of customers. And not just any customers – Prime\nmembers. FBA products can be eligible for Prime free two-day shipping. Customers benefit from this additional\nselection – they get even more value out of their Prime membership. And, unsurprisingly, sellers see increased\nsales when they join FBA. In a 2013 survey, nearly three out of four FBA respondents reported that their unit\nsales increased on Amazon.com more than 20% after joining FBA. It’s a win-win.\n“FBA is the best employee I have ever had. … One morning I woke up and realized FBA had\nshipped 50 units. As soon as I realized I could sell products while I sleep, it was a no-brainer.”\n– Thanny Schuck, Action Sports LLC\n“Starting out as an unknown brand, it was difficult to find retailers willing to stock our goods. No\nsuch barriers existed at Amazon. The beauty of Amazon is that someone can say, ‘I want to start a\nbusiness,’ and they can go on Amazon and really start a business. You don’t have to get a lease on a\nbuilding or even have any employees at first. You can just do it on your own. And that’s what I did.”\n– Wendell Morris, YogaRat\nLogin and Pay with Amazon\nFor several years we’ve enabled Amazon customers to pay on other sites, such as Kickstarter, SmugMug,\nand Gogo Inflight, using the credit cards and shipping addresses already stored in their Amazon account. This\nyear, we expanded that capability so customers can also sign in using their Amazon account credentials, saving\nthem the annoyance of needing to remember yet another account name and password. It’s convenient for the\ncustomer and a business builder for the merchant. Cymax Stores, the online furniture retailer, has seen\ntremendous success with Login and Pay. It now accounts for 20% of their orders, tripling their new account\nregistrations, and increasing purchase conversion 3.15% in the first three months. This example isn’t unusual.\nWe are seeing results like these with many partners, and the team is excited and encouraged. You should look for\nmore in 2014.\nAmazon Smile\nIn 2013 we launched Amazon Smile – a simple way for customers to support their favorite charitable\norganizations every time they shop. When you shop at smile.amazon.com, Amazon donates a portion of the\npurchase price to the charity of your choice. You’ll find the same selection, prices, shipping options, and Prime\neligibility on smile.amazon.com as you do on Amazon.com – you’ll even find your same shopping cart and wish\nlists. In addition to the large, national charities you would expect, you can also designate your local children’s\nhospital, your school’s PTA, or practically any other cause you might like. There are almost a million charities to\nchoose from. I hope you’ll find your favorite on the list.\nThe Mayday Button\n“Not only is the device awesome but the Mayday feature is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!! The Kindle team has hit\nit out of the park with this one.”\n“Just tried the mayday button on my hdx. 15 second response time…amazon has done it again. Thoroughly\nimpressed.”\nNothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than “reinventing normal” – creating inventions that customers\nlove and resetting their expectations for what normal should be. Mayday reimagines and revolutionizes the idea\nof on-device tech support. Tap the Mayday button, and an Amazon expert will appear on your Fire HDX and can\nco-pilot you through any feature by drawing on your screen, walking you through how to do something yourself,\nor doing it for you – whatever works best. Mayday is available 24x7, 365 days a year, and our response time goal\nis 15 seconds or less. We beat that goal – with an average response time of only 9 seconds on our busiest day,\nChristmas.\nA few of the Maydays have been amusing. Mayday Tech Advisors have received 35 marriage proposals\nfrom customers. 475 customers have asked to talk to Amy, our Mayday television personality. 109 Maydays have\nbeen customers asking for assistance with ordering a pizza. By a slim margin, Pizza Hut wins customer\npreference over Domino’s. There are 44 instances where the Mayday Tech Advisor has sung Happy Birthday to\nthe customer. Mayday Tech Advisors have been serenaded by customers 648 times. And 3 customers have asked\nfor a bedtime story. Pretty cool.\nI hope that gives you some sense of the scope of our opportunity and initiatives, as well the inventive spirit\nand push for exceptional quality with which they’re undertaken. I should underscore again that this is a subset.\nThere are many programs I’ve omitted in this letter that are just as promising, consequential, and interesting as\nthose I’ve highlighted.\nWe have the good fortune of a large, inventive team and a patient, pioneering, customer-obsessed culture –\ngreat innovations, large and small, are happening everyday on behalf of customers, and at all levels throughout\nthe company. This decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company – not limited to the company’s\nsenior leaders – is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation. What we’re doing is challenging and\nfun – we get to work in the future.\nFailure comes part and parcel with invention. It’s not optional. We understand that and believe in failing\nearly and iterating until we get it right. When this process works, it means our failures are relatively small in size\n(most experiments can start small), and when we hit on something that is really working for customers, we\ndouble-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it’s not always as clean as that.\nInventing is messy, and over time, it’s certain that we’ll fail at some big bets too.\nI’d like to close by remembering Joy Covey. Joy was Amazon’s CFO in the early days, and she left an\nindelible mark on the company. Joy was brilliant, intense, and so fun. She smiled a lot and her eyes were always\nwide, missing nothing. She was substance over optics. She was a long-term thinker. She had a deep keel. Joy was\nbold. She had a profound impact on all of us on the senior team and on the company’s entire culture. Part of her\nwill always be here, making sure we watch the details, see the world around us, and all have fun.\nI feel super lucky to be a part of the Amazon team. As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter.\nOur approach remains the same, and it’s still Day 1.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nApril 2014\n\nFirst, find the quotes from the document that are most relevant to answering the question, and then print them in numbered order. Quotes should be relatively short.\n\nIf there are no relevant quotes, write “No relevant quotes” instead.\n\nThen, answer the question, starting with “Answer:”.

Publishers—including all the major publishers—have embraced Kindle, and we’re thankful for that. From a publisher’s point of view, there are a lot of advantages to Kindle. Books never go out of print, and they never go out of stock. Nor is there ever waste from over-printing. Most important, Kindle makes it more convenient for readers to buy more books.

Our established businesses are well-rooted young trees. They are growing, enjoy high returns on capital, and operate in very large market segments. These characteristics set a high bar for any new business we would start. Before we invest our shareholders’ money in a new business, we must convince ourselves that the ne opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon. And we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company. Furthermore, we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved and that we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace. Without that, it’s unlikely we’d get to scale in that new business. I often get asked, “When are you going to open physical stores?” That’s an expansion opportunity we’ve resisted. It fails all but one of the tests outlined above. The potential size of a network of physical stores is exciting. However: we don’t know how to do it with low capital and high returns; physical-world retailing is a cagey and ancient business that’s already well served; and we don’t have any ideas for how to build a physical world store experience that’s meaningfully differentiated for customers. When you do see us enter new businesses, it’s because we believe the above tests have been passed. Our acquisition of Joyo.com is a first step in serving the most populous country in the world. E-commerce in China is still in its early days, and we believe it’s an excellent business opportunity. Shoes, apparel, groceries: these are big segments where we have the right skills to invent and grow large-scale, high-return businesses that genuinely improve customer experience. Fulfillment by Amazon is a set of web services API’s that turns our 12 million square foot fulfillment center network into a gigantic and sophisticated computer peripheral. Pay us 45 cents per month per cubic foot of fulfillment center space, and you can stow your products in our network. You make web services calls to alert us to expect inventory to arrive, to tell us to pick and pack one or more items, and to tell us where to ship those items. You never have to talk to us. It’s differentiated, can be large, and passes our returns bar. Amazon Web Services is another example. With AWS, we’re building a new business focused on a new customer set … software developers. We currently offer ten different web services and have built a community of over 240,000 registered developers. We’re targeting broad needs universally faced by developers, such as storage and compute capacity—areas in which developers have asked for help, and in which we have deep expertise from scaling Amazon.com over the last twelve years. We’re well positioned to do it, it’s highly differentiated, and it can be a significant, financially attractive business over time. In some large companies, it might be difficult to grow new businesses from tiny seeds because of the patience and nurturing required. In my view, Amazon’s culture is unusually supportive of small businesses with big potential, and I believe that’s a source of competitive advantage. Like any company, we have a corporate culture formed not only by our intentions but also as a result of our history. For Amazon, that history is fairly fresh and, fortunately, it includes several examples of tiny seeds growing into big trees. We have many people at our company who have watched multiple $10 million seeds turn into billion dollar businesses. That first-hand experience and the culture that has grown up around those successes is, in my opinion, a big part of why we can start businesses from scratch. The culture demands that these new businesses be high potential and that they be innovative and differentiated, but it does not demand that they be large on the day that they are born. I remember how excited we were in 1996 as we crossed $10 million in book sales. It wasn’t hard to be excited—we had grown to $10 million from zero. Today, when a new business inside Amazon grows to $10 million, the overall company is growing from $10 billion to $10.01 billion. It would be easy for the senior executives who run our established billion dollar businesses to scoff. But they don’t. They watch the growth rates of the emerging businesses and send emails of congratulations. That’s pretty cool, and we’re proud it’s a part of our culture. In our experience, if a new business enjoys runaway success, it can only begin to be meaningful to the overall company economics in something like three to seven years. We’ve seen those time frames with our international businesses, our earlier non-media businesses, and our third party seller businesses. Today, international is 45% of sales, non-media is 34% of sales, and our third party seller businesses account for 28% of our units sold. We will be happy indeed if some of the new seeds we’re planting enjoy similar successes. We’ve come a distance since we celebrated our first $10 million in sales. As we continue to grow, we’ll work to maintain a culture that embraces new businesses. We will do so in a disciplined way, with an eye on returns, potential size, and the ability to create differentiation that customers care about. We won’t always choose right, and we won’t always succeed. But we will be choosy, and we will work hard and patiently. As always, I attach our 1997 letter to shareholders. You’ll see that our philosophy and approach have not changed. Many thanks for your support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc."}

The goal is to give you a sense for how much is going on across Amazon and how\nexciting it is to work on these programs. This broad array of initiatives is only possible because a large team of\ntalented people at every level are exercising their good judgment every day and always asking, how do we make\nthis better?\nOk, let\u2019s get started on the tour.\nPrime\nCustomers love Prime. More than one million customers joined Prime in the third week of December alone,\nand there are now tens of millions of Prime members worldwide. On a per customer basis, Prime members are\nordering more items, across more categories, than ever before. Even internally, it\u2019s easy for us to forget that\nPrime was a new, unproven (some even said foolhardy) concept when we launched it nine years ago: all-you-\ncan-eat, two-day shipping for a flat annual fee. At that time, we had one million eligible Prime products. This\nyear, we passed 20 million eligible products, and we continue to add more. We\u2019ve made Prime better in other\nways too, adding new digital benefits \u2013 including the Kindle Owners\u2019 Lending Library and Prime Instant Video.\nAnd we\u2019re not done. We have many ideas for how to make Prime even better.\nReaders & Authors\nWe\u2019re investing heavily on behalf of readers. The all-new, high-resolution, high-contrast Kindle Paperwhite\nlaunched to rave reviews. We integrated the very impressive Goodreads into Kindle, introduced FreeTime for\nKindle, and launched Kindle in India, Mexico, and Australia. Bringing joy to air travelers, the FAA approved the\nuse of electronic devices during takeoff and landing. Our public policy team, with the help of many allies,\nworked patiently for four years on this, at one point loading a test plane with 150 active Kindles. Yes, it all\nworked fine!\nJoining CreateSpace, Kindle Singles, and Kindle Direct Publishing, is the new service Kindle Worlds, the\nliterary journal Day One, eight new Amazon Publishing imprints, and the launch of Amazon Publishing in the\nUK and Germany. Thousands of authors are already using these services to build fulfilling writing careers. Many\nwrite and tell us how we have helped them send their children to college, pay off medical bills, or purchase a\nhome. We are missionaries for reading and these stories inspire and encourage us to keep inventing on behalf of\nwriters and readers.\nPrime Instant Video\nPrime Instant Video is experiencing tremendous growth across all metrics \u2013 including new customers,\nrepeat usage, and total number of streams. These are output metrics and they suggest we are on a good path,\nfocusing on the right inputs. Two of the key inputs are the growth of selection and the desirability of that\nselection. Since we launched PIV in 2011 with 5,000 titles, we\u2019ve grown selection to more than 40,000 movies\nand TV episodes \u2013 all included in your Prime membership. PIV has exclusives on hundreds of sought after TV\nseasons including Downton Abbey, the ratings blockbuster Under the Dome, The Americans, Justified, Grimm,\nOrphan Black, Suits, and kids programs such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and Blue\u2019s Clues.\nIn addition, our Amazon Studios team continues to invest heavily in original content. Garry Trudeau\u2019s Alpha\nHouse, starring John Goodman, debuted last year and quickly became the most-watched show on Amazon. We\nrecently greenlit six more originals, including Bosch, by Michael Connelly, The After, from Chris Carter of The\nX-Files, Mozart in the Jungle, from Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, and Jill Soloway\u2019s beautiful\nTransparent, which some have called the best pilot in years. We like our approach and are replicating it with our\nrecent rollout of PIV in both the UK and Germany. The early customer response in those countries has been\nterrific, surpassing our expectations.\nFire TV\nJust this past week, after two years of hard work, our hardware team launched Fire TV. Not only is Fire TV\nthe best way to watch Amazon\u2019s video offerings, it also embraces non-Amazon content services like Netflix,\nHulu Plus, VEVO, WatchESPN, and many more. Fire TV has big hardware specs in a category that\u2019s previously\nbeen hardware-light. It shows. Fire TV is fast and fluid. And our ASAP technology predicts what you might want\nto watch and pre-buffers it, so shows start instantly. Our team also put a small microphone in the remote control.\nHold down the mic button on the remote, and you can speak your search term rather than type it into an alphabet\ngrid. The team has done a terrific job \u2013 the voice search actually works.\nIn addition to Prime Instant Video, Fire TV gives you instant access to over 200,000 movies and TV\nepisodes available a la carte, including new releases like Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, Dallas Buyers Club, Frozen,\nand more. As a bonus, Fire TV also lets you play high-quality, inexpensive games on your living room TV. We\nhope you try it out. If you do, let us know what you think. The team would love to hear your feedback.\nAmazon Game Studios\nIt\u2019s early in the twenty-second century and Earth is threatened by an alien species, the Ne\u2019ahtu.\nThe aliens infected Earth\u2019s energy grid with a computer virus to disable the planet\u2019s defenses.\nBefore they could strike, computer science prodigy Amy Ramanujan neutralized the alien virus\nand saved the planet. Now, the Ne\u2019ahtu are back and Dr. Ramanujan must prevent them from\nlaunching an all-out invasion on Earth. She needs your help.\nThat\u2019s how Sev Zero, the first Fire TV exclusive from Amazon Game Studios, begins. The team combined\ntower defense with shooter gameplay and created a co-op mode where one player leads on the ground with their\ngamepad controller while a second player provides air support from a tablet. I can assure you that there are some\nintense moments when you\u2019ll appreciate a well-timed air-strike. When you see it, you may be surprised that this\nlevel of game play is possible on an inexpensive streaming media device. Sev Zero is only the first of a collection\nof innovative and graphically beautiful games we\u2019re building from the ground up for Fire tablets and Fire TV.\nAmazon Appstore\nThe Amazon Appstore now serves customers in almost 200 countries. Selection has grown to include over\n200,000 apps and games from top developers around the globe \u2013 nearly tripling in size over the past year. We\nintroduced Amazon Coins, a virtual currency that saves customers up to 10% on app and in-app purchases. Our\nWhispersync for Games technology lets you start a game on one device and continue it on another without losing\nyour progress. Developers can use the Mobile Associates program to offer millions of physical products from\nAmazon inside their apps, and earn referral fees when customers buy those items. We introduced Appstore\nDeveloper Select, a marketing program that promotes new apps and games on Kindle Fire tablets and on\nAmazon\u2019s Mobile Ad Network. We created Analytics and A/B Testing services \u2013 free services that empower\ndevelopers to track user engagement and optimize their apps for iOS, Android, and Fire OS. Also this year, we\nembraced HTML5 web app developers. They too can now offer their apps on Kindle Fire and through the\nAmazon Appstore.\nSpoken Word Audio\n2013 was a landmark year for Audible, the world\u2019s largest seller and producer of audiobooks. Audible\nmakes it possible for you to read when your eyes are busy. Millions of customers download hundreds of millions\nof audiobooks and other spoken-word programming from Audible. Audible customers downloaded close to\n600 million listening hours in 2013. Thanks to Audible Studios, people drive to work listening to Kate Winslet,\nColin Firth, Anne Hathaway, and many other stars. One big hit in 2013 was Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance of\nThe Great Gatsby, which has already sold 100,000 copies. Whispersync for Voice allows customers to switch\nseamlessly back and forth between reading a book on their Kindle and listening to the corresponding Audible\nbook on their smart phone. The Wall Street Journal called Whispersync for Voice \u201cAmazon\u2019s new killer app for\nbooks.\u201d If you haven\u2019t already, I recommend you give it a try \u2013 it\u2019s fun and expands the amount of time you have\navailable to read.\nFresh Grocery\nAfter trialing the service for five years in Seattle (no one accuses us of a lack of patience), we expanded\nAmazon Fresh to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Prime Fresh members pay $299 a year and receive same-day\nand early morning delivery not only on fresh grocery items but also on over 500,000 other items ranging from\ntoys to electronics to household goods. We\u2019re also partnering with favorite local merchants (the Cheese Store of\nBeverly Hills, Pike Place Fish Market, San Francisco Wine Trading Company, and many more) to provide the\nsame convenient home delivery on a great selection of prepared foods and specialty items. We\u2019ll continue our\nmethodical approach \u2013 measuring and refining Amazon Fresh \u2013 with the goal of bringing this incredible service\nto more cities over time.\nAmazon Web Services\nAWS is eight years old, and the team\u2019s pace of innovation is actually accelerating. In 2010, we launched 61\nsignificant services and features. In 2011, that number was 82. In 2012, it was 159. In 2013: 280. We\u2019re also\nexpanding our geographic footprint. We now have 10 AWS regions around the world, including the East Coast of\nthe U.S., two on the West Coast, Europe, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Brazil, China, and a government-only\nregion called GovCloud. We have 26 availability zones across regions and 51 edge locations for our content\ndistribution network. The development teams work directly with customers and are empowered to design, build,\nand launch based on what they learn. We iterate continuously, and when a feature or enhancement is ready, we\npush it out and make it instantly available to all. This approach is fast, customer-centric, and efficient \u2013 it\u2019s\nallowed us to reduce prices more than 40 times in the past 8 years \u2013 and the teams have no plans to slow down.\nEmployee Empowerment\nWe challenge ourselves to not only invent outward facing features, but also to find better ways to do things\ninternally \u2013 things that will both make us more effective and benefit our thousands of employees around the\nworld.\nCareer Choice is a program where we pre-pay 95% of tuition for our employees to take courses for in-\ndemand fields, such as airplane mechanic or nursing, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at\nAmazon. The goal is to enable choice. We know that for some of our fulfillment center employees, Amazon will\nbe a career. For others, Amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job somewhere else \u2013 a job that may\nrequire new skills. If the right training can make the difference, we want to help.\nThe second program is called Pay to Quit. It was invented by the clever people at Zappos, and the Amazon\nfulfillment centers have been iterating on it. Pay to Quit is pretty simple. Once a year, we offer to pay our\nassociates to quit. The first year the offer is made, it\u2019s for $2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year\nuntil it reaches $5,000. The headline on the offer is \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Take This Offer.\u201d We hope they don\u2019t take the\noffer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and\nthink about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don\u2019t want to be isn\u2019t\nhealthy for the employee or the company.\nA third inward innovation is our Virtual Contact Center. It\u2019s an idea we started a few years back and have\ncontinued to grow with terrific results. Under this program, employees provide customer service support for\nAmazon and Kindle customers while working from home. This flexibility is ideal for many employees who,\nperhaps because they have young children or for another reason, either cannot or prefer not to work outside the\nhome. Our Virtual Contact Center is our fastest growing \u201csite\u201d in the U.S., operating in more than ten states\ntoday. This growth will continue as we hope to double our state footprint in 2014.\nVeteran Hiring\nWe seek leaders who can invent, think big, have a bias for action, and deliver results on behalf of customers.\nThese principles look familiar to men and women who\u2019ve served our country in the armed forces, and we find\nthat their experience leading people is invaluable in our fast-paced work environment. We\u2019re a member of\nJoining Forces and the 100,000 Jobs Mission \u2013 two national efforts that encourage businesses to offer service\nmembers and their families career opportunities and support. Our Military Talent team attended more than 50\nrecruiting events last year to help veterans find job opportunities at Amazon. In 2013, we hired more than 1,900\nveterans. And once veterans join our team, we offer several programs that help them transition more easily into\nthe civilian workforce and that connect them with our internal network of veterans for mentoring and support.\nThese programs have earned us recognition as a top employer by G.I. Jobs Magazine, U.S. Veterans Magazine,\nand Military Spouse Magazine, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in military veteran hiring as we grow.\nFulfillment Innovation\nNineteen years ago, I drove the Amazon packages to the post office every evening in the back of my Chevy\nBlazer. My vision extended so far that I dreamed we might one day get a forklift. Fast-forward to today and we\nhave 96 fulfillment centers and are on our 7th generation of fulfillment center design. Our operations team is\nextraordinary \u2013 methodical and ingenious. Through our Kaizen program, named for the Japanese term \u201cchange\nfor the better,\u201d employees work in small teams to streamline processes and reduce defects and waste. Our Earth\nKaizens set energy reduction, recycling, and other green goals. In 2013, more than 4,700 associates participated\nin 1,100 Kaizens.\nSophisticated software is key in our FCs. This year, we rolled out 280 major software improvements across\nthe FC network. Our goal is to continue to iterate and improve on the design, layout, technology, and operations\nin these buildings, ensuring that each new facility we build is better than the last. I invite you to come see one for\nyourself. We offer fulfillment center tours open to the public, ages six and above. You can find info on the\navailable tours at www.amazon.com/fctours   . I\u2019m always amazed when I visit one of our FCs, and I hope you\u2019ll\narrange a tour. I think you\u2019ll be impressed.\nUrban Campus\nIn 2013, we added 420,000 square feet of new headquarters space in Seattle and broke ground on what will\nbecome four city blocks and several million square feet of new construction. It is a fact that we could have saved\nmoney by instead building in the suburbs, but for us, it was important to stay in the city. Urban campuses are\nmuch greener. Our employees are able to take advantage of existing communities and public transit\ninfrastructure, with less dependence on cars. We\u2019re investing in dedicated bike lanes to provide safe, pollution-\nfree, easy access to our offices. Many of our employees can live nearby, skip the commute altogether, and walk\nto work. Though I can\u2019t prove it, I also believe an urban headquarters will help keep Amazon vibrant, attract the\nright talent, and be great for the health and wellbeing of our employees and the city of Seattle.\nFast Delivery\nIn partnership with the United States Postal Service, we\u2019ve begun for the first time to offer Sunday delivery\nto select cities. Sunday delivery is a win for Amazon customers, and we plan to roll it out to a large portion of the\nU.S. population throughout 2014. We\u2019ve created our own fast, last-mile delivery networks in the UK where\ncommercial carriers couldn\u2019t support our peak volumes. In India and China, where delivery infrastructure isn\u2019t\nyet mature, you can see Amazon bike couriers delivering packages throughout the major cities. And there is more\ninvention to come. The Prime Air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles, and we\nare in the design phase on generations 7 and 8.\nExperiments and More Experiments\nWe have our own internal experimentation platform called \u201cWeblab\u201d that we use to evaluate improvements\nto our websites and products. In 2013, we ran 1,976 Weblabs worldwide, up from 1,092 in 2012, and 546 in\n2011. One recent success is our new feature called \u201cAsk an owner\u201d. It was many years ago that we pioneered the\nidea of online customer reviews \u2013 customers sharing their opinion on a product to help other customers make an\ninformed purchase decision. \u201cAsk\u201d is in that same tradition. From a product page, customers can ask any\nquestion related to the product. Is the product compatible with my TV/Stereo/PC? Is it easy to assemble? How\nlong does the battery last? We then route these questions to owners of the product. As is the case with reviews,\ncustomers are happy to share their knowledge to directly help other customers. Millions of questions have\nalready been asked and answered.\nApparel and Shoes\nAmazon Fashion is booming. Premium brands are recognizing that they can use Amazon to reach fashion-\nconscious, high-demo customers, and customers are enjoying the selection, free returns, detailed photos, and\nvideo clips that let them see how clothes move and drape as the models walk and turn. We opened a new 40,000\nsquare foot photo studio in Brooklyn and now shoot an average of 10,413 photos every day in the studio\u2019s\n28 bays. To celebrate the opening, we hosted a design contest with students from Pratt, Parsons, School of Visual\nArts, and the Fashion Institute of Technology that was judged by a panel of industry leaders including Steven\nKolb, Eva Chen, Derek Lam, Tracy Reese, and Steven Alan. Kudos to Parsons who took home the top prize.\nFrustration-Free Packaging\nOur battle against annoying wire ties and plastic clamshells rages on. An initiative that began five years ago\nwith a simple idea that you shouldn\u2019t have to risk bodily injury opening your new electronics or toys, has now\ngrown to over 200,000 products, all available in easy-to-open, recyclable packaging designed to alleviate \u201cwrap\nrage\u201d and help the planet by reducing packaging waste. We have over 2,000 manufacturers in our Frustration-\nFree Packaging program, including Fisher-Price, Mattel, Unilever, Belkin, Victorinox Swiss Army, Logitech, and\nmany more. We\u2019ve now shipped many millions of Frustration-Free items to 175 countries. We are also reducing\nwaste for customers \u2013 eliminating 33 million pounds of excess packaging to date. This program is a perfect\nexample of a missionary team staying heads-down focused on serving customers. Through hard work and\nperseverance, an idea that started with only 19 products is now available on hundreds of thousands and benefiting\nmillions of customers.\nFulfillment by Amazon\nThe number of sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon grew more than 65% last year. Growth like that at such\nlarge scale is unusual. FBA is unique in many ways. It\u2019s not often you get to delight two customer sets with one\nprogram. With FBA, sellers can store their products in our fulfillment centers, and we pick, pack, ship, and\nprovide customer service for these products. Sellers benefit from one of the most advanced fulfillment networks\nin the world, easily scaling their businesses to reach millions of customers. And not just any customers \u2013 Prime\nmembers. FBA products can be eligible for Prime free two-day shipping. Customers benefit from this additional\nselection \u2013 they get even more value out of their Prime membership. And, unsurprisingly, sellers see increased\nsales when they join FBA. In a 2013 survey, nearly three out of four FBA respondents reported that their unit\nsales increased on Amazon.com more than 20% after joining FBA. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\u201cFBA is the best employee I have ever had. \u2026 One morning I woke up and realized FBA had\nshipped 50 units. As soon as I realized I could sell products while I sleep, it was a no-brainer.\u201d\n\u2013 Thanny Schuck, Action Sports LLC\n\u201cStarting out as an unknown brand, it was difficult to find retailers willing to stock our goods. No\nsuch barriers existed at Amazon. The beauty of Amazon is that someone can say, \u2018I want to start a\nbusiness,\u2019 and they can go on Amazon and really start a business. You don\u2019t have to get a lease on a\nbuilding or even have any employees at first. You can just do it on your own. And that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\u2013 Wendell Morris, YogaRat\nLogin and Pay with Amazon\nFor several years we\u2019ve enabled Amazon customers to pay on other sites, such as Kickstarter, SmugMug,\nand Gogo Inflight, using the credit cards and shipping addresses already stored in their Amazon account. This\nyear, we expanded that capability so customers can also sign in using their Amazon account credentials, saving\nthem the annoyance of needing to remember yet another account name and password. It\u2019s convenient for the\ncustomer and a business builder for the merchant. Cymax Stores, the online furniture retailer, has seen\ntremendous success with Login and Pay. It now accounts for 20% of their orders, tripling their new account\nregistrations, and increasing purchase conversion 3.15% in the first three months. This example isn\u2019t unusual.\nWe are seeing results like these with many partners, and the team is excited and encouraged. You should look for\nmore in 2014.\nAmazon Smile\nIn 2013 we launched Amazon Smile \u2013 a simple way for customers to support their favorite charitable\norganizations every time they shop. When you shop at smile.amazon.com, Amazon donates a portion of the\npurchase price to the charity of your choice. You\u2019ll find the same selection, prices, shipping options, and Prime\neligibility on smile.amazon.com as you do on Amazon.com \u2013 you\u2019ll even find your same shopping cart and wish\nlists. In addition to the large, national charities you would expect, you can also designate your local children\u2019s\nhospital, your school\u2019s PTA, or practically any other cause you might like. There are almost a million charities to\nchoose from. I hope you\u2019ll find your favorite on the list.\nThe Mayday Button\n\u201cNot only is the device awesome but the Mayday feature is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!! The Kindle team has hit\nit out of the park with this one.\u201d\n\u201cJust tried the mayday button on my hdx. 15 second response time\u2026amazon has done it again. Thoroughly\nimpressed.\u201d\nNothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than \u201creinventing normal\u201d \u2013 creating inventions that customers\nlove and resetting their expectations for what normal should be. Mayday reimagines and revolutionizes the idea\nof on-device tech support. Tap the Mayday button, and an Amazon expert will appear on your Fire HDX and can\nco-pilot you through any feature by drawing on your screen, walking you through how to do something yourself,\nor doing it for you \u2013 whatever works best. Mayday is available 24x7, 365 days a year, and our response time goal\nis 15 seconds or less. We beat that goal \u2013 with an average response time of only 9 seconds on our busiest day,\nChristmas.\nA few of the Maydays have been amusing. Mayday Tech Advisors have received 35 marriage proposals\nfrom customers. 475 customers have asked to talk to Amy, our Mayday television personality. 109 Maydays have\nbeen customers asking for assistance with ordering a pizza. By a slim margin, Pizza Hut wins customer\npreference over Domino\u2019s. There are 44 instances where the Mayday Tech Advisor has sung Happy Birthday to\nthe customer. Mayday Tech Advisors have been serenaded by customers 648 times. And 3 customers have asked\nfor a bedtime story. Pretty cool.\nI hope that gives you some sense of the scope of our opportunity and initiatives, as well the inventive spirit\nand push for exceptional quality with which they\u2019re undertaken. I should underscore again that this is a subset.\nThere are many programs I\u2019ve omitted in this letter that are just as promising, consequential, and interesting as\nthose I\u2019ve highlighted.\nWe have the good fortune of a large, inventive team and a patient, pioneering, customer-obsessed culture \u2013\ngreat innovations, large and small, are happening everyday on behalf of customers, and at all levels throughout\nthe company. This decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company \u2013 not limited to the company\u2019s\nsenior leaders \u2013 is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation. What we\u2019re doing is challenging and\nfun \u2013 we get to work in the future.\nFailure comes part and parcel with invention. It\u2019s not optional. We understand that and believe in failing\nearly and iterating until we get it right. When this process works, it means our failures are relatively small in size\n(most experiments can start small), and when we hit on something that is really working for customers, we\ndouble-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it\u2019s not always as clean as that.\nInventing is messy, and over time, it\u2019s certain that we\u2019ll fail at some big bets too.\nI\u2019d like to close by remembering Joy Covey. Joy was Amazon\u2019s CFO in the early days, and she left an\nindelible mark on the company. Joy was brilliant, intense, and so fun. She smiled a lot and her eyes were always\nwide, missing nothing. She was substance over optics. She was a long-term thinker. She had a deep keel. Joy was\nbold. She had a profound impact on all of us on the senior team and on the company\u2019s entire culture. Part of her\nwill always be here, making sure we watch the details, see the world around us, and all have fun.\nI feel super lucky to be a part of the Amazon team. As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter.\nOur approach remains the same, and it\u2019s still Day 1.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nApril 2014"}

This broad array of initiatives is only possible because a large team of\ntalented people at every level are exercising their good judgment every day and always asking, how do we make\nthis better?\nOk, let\u2019s get started on the tour.\nPrime\nCustomers love Prime. More than one million customers joined Prime in the third week of December alone,\nand there are now tens of millions of Prime members worldwide. On a per customer basis, Prime members are\nordering more items, across more categories, than ever before. Even internally, it\u2019s easy for us to forget that\nPrime was a new, unproven (some even said foolhardy) concept when we launched it nine years ago: all-you-\ncan-eat, two-day shipping for a flat annual fee. At that time, we had one million eligible Prime products. This\nyear, we passed 20 million eligible products, and we continue to add more. We\u2019ve made Prime better in other\nways too, adding new digital benefits \u2013 including the Kindle Owners\u2019 Lending Library and Prime Instant Video.\nAnd we\u2019re not done. We have many ideas for how to make Prime even better.\nReaders & Authors\nWe\u2019re investing heavily on behalf of readers. The all-new, high-resolution, high-contrast Kindle Paperwhite\nlaunched to rave reviews. We integrated the very impressive Goodreads into Kindle, introduced FreeTime for\nKindle, and launched Kindle in India, Mexico, and Australia. Bringing joy to air travelers, the FAA approved the\nuse of electronic devices during takeoff and landing. Our public policy team, with the help of many allies,\nworked patiently for four years on this, at one point loading a test plane with 150 active Kindles. Yes, it all\nworked fine!\nJoining CreateSpace, Kindle Singles, and Kindle Direct Publishing, is the new service Kindle Worlds, the\nliterary journal Day One, eight new Amazon Publishing imprints, and the launch of Amazon Publishing in the\nUK and Germany. Thousands of authors are already using these services to build fulfilling writing careers. Many\nwrite and tell us how we have helped them send their children to college, pay off medical bills, or purchase a\nhome. We are missionaries for reading and these stories inspire and encourage us to keep inventing on behalf of\nwriters and readers.\nPrime Instant Video\nPrime Instant Video is experiencing tremendous growth across all metrics \u2013 including new customers,\nrepeat usage, and total number of streams. These are output metrics and they suggest we are on a good path,\nfocusing on the right inputs. Two of the key inputs are the growth of selection and the desirability of that\nselection. Since we launched PIV in 2011 with 5,000 titles, we\u2019ve grown selection to more than 40,000 movies\nand TV episodes \u2013 all included in your Prime membership. PIV has exclusives on hundreds of sought after TV\nseasons including Downton Abbey, the ratings blockbuster Under the Dome, The Americans, Justified, Grimm,\nOrphan Black, Suits, and kids programs such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and Blue\u2019s Clues.\nIn addition, our Amazon Studios team continues to invest heavily in original content. Garry Trudeau\u2019s Alpha\nHouse, starring John Goodman, debuted last year and quickly became the most-watched show on Amazon. We\nrecently greenlit six more originals, including Bosch, by Michael Connelly, The After, from Chris Carter of The\nX-Files, Mozart in the Jungle, from Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, and Jill Soloway\u2019s beautiful\nTransparent, which some have called the best pilot in years. We like our approach and are replicating it with our\nrecent rollout of PIV in both the UK and Germany. The early customer response in those countries has been\nterrific, surpassing our expectations.\nFire TV\nJust this past week, after two years of hard work, our hardware team launched Fire TV. Not only is Fire TV\nthe best way to watch Amazon\u2019s video offerings, it also embraces non-Amazon content services like Netflix,\nHulu Plus, VEVO, WatchESPN, and many more. Fire TV has big hardware specs in a category that\u2019s previously\nbeen hardware-light. It shows. Fire TV is fast and fluid. And our ASAP technology predicts what you might want\nto watch and pre-buffers it, so shows start instantly. Our team also put a small microphone in the remote control.\nHold down the mic button on the remote, and you can speak your search term rather than type it into an alphabet\ngrid. The team has done a terrific job \u2013 the voice search actually works.\nIn addition to Prime Instant Video, Fire TV gives you instant access to over 200,000 movies and TV\nepisodes available a la carte, including new releases like Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, Dallas Buyers Club, Frozen,\nand more. As a bonus, Fire TV also lets you play high-quality, inexpensive games on your living room TV. We\nhope you try it out. If you do, let us know what you think. The team would love to hear your feedback.\nAmazon Game Studios\nIt\u2019s early in the twenty-second century and Earth is threatened by an alien species, the Ne\u2019ahtu.\nThe aliens infected Earth\u2019s energy grid with a computer virus to disable the planet\u2019s defenses.\nBefore they could strike, computer science prodigy Amy Ramanujan neutralized the alien virus\nand saved the planet. Now, the Ne\u2019ahtu are back and Dr. Ramanujan must prevent them from\nlaunching an all-out invasion on Earth. She needs your help.\nThat\u2019s how Sev Zero, the first Fire TV exclusive from Amazon Game Studios, begins. The team combined\ntower defense with shooter gameplay and created a co-op mode where one player leads on the ground with their\ngamepad controller while a second player provides air support from a tablet. I can assure you that there are some\nintense moments when you\u2019ll appreciate a well-timed air-strike. When you see it, you may be surprised that this\nlevel of game play is possible on an inexpensive streaming media device. Sev Zero is only the first of a collection\nof innovative and graphically beautiful games we\u2019re building from the ground up for Fire tablets and Fire TV.\nAmazon Appstore\nThe Amazon Appstore now serves customers in almost 200 countries. Selection has grown to include over\n200,000 apps and games from top developers around the globe \u2013 nearly tripling in size over the past year. We\nintroduced Amazon Coins, a virtual currency that saves customers up to 10% on app and in-app purchases. Our\nWhispersync for Games technology lets you start a game on one device and continue it on another without losing\nyour progress. Developers can use the Mobile Associates program to offer millions of physical products from\nAmazon inside their apps, and earn referral fees when customers buy those items. We introduced Appstore\nDeveloper Select, a marketing program that promotes new apps and games on Kindle Fire tablets and on\nAmazon\u2019s Mobile Ad Network. We created Analytics and A/B Testing services \u2013 free services that empower\ndevelopers to track user engagement and optimize their apps for iOS, Android, and Fire OS. Also this year, we\nembraced HTML5 web app developers. They too can now offer their apps on Kindle Fire and through the\nAmazon Appstore.\nSpoken Word Audio\n2013 was a landmark year for Audible, the world\u2019s largest seller and producer of audiobooks. Audible\nmakes it possible for you to read when your eyes are busy. Millions of customers download hundreds of millions\nof audiobooks and other spoken-word programming from Audible. Audible customers downloaded close to\n600 million listening hours in 2013. Thanks to Audible Studios, people drive to work listening to Kate Winslet,\nColin Firth, Anne Hathaway, and many other stars. One big hit in 2013 was Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance of\nThe Great Gatsby, which has already sold 100,000 copies. Whispersync for Voice allows customers to switch\nseamlessly back and forth between reading a book on their Kindle and listening to the corresponding Audible\nbook on their smart phone. The Wall Street Journal called Whispersync for Voice \u201cAmazon\u2019s new killer app for\nbooks.\u201d If you haven\u2019t already, I recommend you give it a try \u2013 it\u2019s fun and expands the amount of time you have\navailable to read.\nFresh Grocery\nAfter trialing the service for five years in Seattle (no one accuses us of a lack of patience), we expanded\nAmazon Fresh to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Prime Fresh members pay $299 a year and receive same-day\nand early morning delivery not only on fresh grocery items but also on over 500,000 other items ranging from\ntoys to electronics to household goods. We\u2019re also partnering with favorite local merchants (the Cheese Store of\nBeverly Hills, Pike Place Fish Market, San Francisco Wine Trading Company, and many more) to provide the\nsame convenient home delivery on a great selection of prepared foods and specialty items. We\u2019ll continue our\nmethodical approach \u2013 measuring and refining Amazon Fresh \u2013 with the goal of bringing this incredible service\nto more cities over time.\nAmazon Web Services\nAWS is eight years old, and the team\u2019s pace of innovation is actually accelerating. In 2010, we launched 61\nsignificant services and features. In 2011, that number was 82. In 2012, it was 159. In 2013: 280. We\u2019re also\nexpanding our geographic footprint. We now have 10 AWS regions around the world, including the East Coast of\nthe U.S., two on the West Coast, Europe, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Brazil, China, and a government-only\nregion called GovCloud. We have 26 availability zones across regions and 51 edge locations for our content\ndistribution network. The development teams work directly with customers and are empowered to design, build,\nand launch based on what they learn. We iterate continuously, and when a feature or enhancement is ready, we\npush it out and make it instantly available to all. This approach is fast, customer-centric, and efficient \u2013 it\u2019s\nallowed us to reduce prices more than 40 times in the past 8 years \u2013 and the teams have no plans to slow down.\nEmployee Empowerment\nWe challenge ourselves to not only invent outward facing features, but also to find better ways to do things\ninternally \u2013 things that will both make us more effective and benefit our thousands of employees around the\nworld.\nCareer Choice is a program where we pre-pay 95% of tuition for our employees to take courses for in-\ndemand fields, such as airplane mechanic or nursing, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at\nAmazon. The goal is to enable choice. We know that for some of our fulfillment center employees, Amazon will\nbe a career. For others, Amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job somewhere else \u2013 a job that may\nrequire new skills. If the right training can make the difference, we want to help.\nThe second program is called Pay to Quit. It was invented by the clever people at Zappos, and the Amazon\nfulfillment centers have been iterating on it. Pay to Quit is pretty simple. Once a year, we offer to pay our\nassociates to quit. The first year the offer is made, it\u2019s for $2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year\nuntil it reaches $5,000. The headline on the offer is \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Take This Offer.\u201d We hope they don\u2019t take the\noffer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and\nthink about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don\u2019t want to be isn\u2019t\nhealthy for the employee or the company.\nA third inward innovation is our Virtual Contact Center. It\u2019s an idea we started a few years back and have\ncontinued to grow with terrific results. Under this program, employees provide customer service support for\nAmazon and Kindle customers while working from home. This flexibility is ideal for many employees who,\nperhaps because they have young children or for another reason, either cannot or prefer not to work outside the\nhome. Our Virtual Contact Center is our fastest growing \u201csite\u201d in the U.S., operating in more than ten states\ntoday. This growth will continue as we hope to double our state footprint in 2014.\nVeteran Hiring\nWe seek leaders who can invent, think big, have a bias for action, and deliver results on behalf of customers.\nThese principles look familiar to men and women who\u2019ve served our country in the armed forces, and we find\nthat their experience leading people is invaluable in our fast-paced work environment. We\u2019re a member of\nJoining Forces and the 100,000 Jobs Mission \u2013 two national efforts that encourage businesses to offer service\nmembers and their families career opportunities and support. Our Military Talent team attended more than 50\nrecruiting events last year to help veterans find job opportunities at Amazon. In 2013, we hired more than 1,900\nveterans. And once veterans join our team, we offer several programs that help them transition more easily into\nthe civilian workforce and that connect them with our internal network of veterans for mentoring and support.\nThese programs have earned us recognition as a top employer by G.I. Jobs Magazine, U.S. Veterans Magazine,\nand Military Spouse Magazine, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in military veteran hiring as we grow.\nFulfillment Innovation\nNineteen years ago, I drove the Amazon packages to the post office every evening in the back of my Chevy\nBlazer. My vision extended so far that I dreamed we might one day get a forklift. Fast-forward to today and we\nhave 96 fulfillment centers and are on our 7th generation of fulfillment center design. Our operations team is\nextraordinary \u2013 methodical and ingenious. Through our Kaizen program, named for the Japanese term \u201cchange\nfor the better,\u201d employees work in small teams to streamline processes and reduce defects and waste. Our Earth\nKaizens set energy reduction, recycling, and other green goals. In 2013, more than 4,700 associates participated\nin 1,100 Kaizens.\nSophisticated software is key in our FCs. This year, we rolled out 280 major software improvements across\nthe FC network. Our goal is to continue to iterate and improve on the design, layout, technology, and operations\nin these buildings, ensuring that each new facility we build is better than the last. I invite you to come see one for\nyourself. We offer fulfillment center tours open to the public, ages six and above. You can find info on the\navailable tours at www.amazon.com/fctours   . I\u2019m always amazed when I visit one of our FCs, and I hope you\u2019ll\narrange a tour. I think you\u2019ll be impressed.\nUrban Campus\nIn 2013, we added 420,000 square feet of new headquarters space in Seattle and broke ground on what will\nbecome four city blocks and several million square feet of new construction. It is a fact that we could have saved\nmoney by instead building in the suburbs, but for us, it was important to stay in the city. Urban campuses are\nmuch greener. Our employees are able to take advantage of existing communities and public transit\ninfrastructure, with less dependence on cars. We\u2019re investing in dedicated bike lanes to provide safe, pollution-\nfree, easy access to our offices. Many of our employees can live nearby, skip the commute altogether, and walk\nto work. Though I can\u2019t prove it, I also believe an urban headquarters will help keep Amazon vibrant, attract the\nright talent, and be great for the health and wellbeing of our employees and the city of Seattle.\nFast Delivery\nIn partnership with the United States Postal Service, we\u2019ve begun for the first time to offer Sunday delivery\nto select cities. Sunday delivery is a win for Amazon customers, and we plan to roll it out to a large portion of the\nU.S. population throughout 2014. We\u2019ve created our own fast, last-mile delivery networks in the UK where\ncommercial carriers couldn\u2019t support our peak volumes. In India and China, where delivery infrastructure isn\u2019t\nyet mature, you can see Amazon bike couriers delivering packages throughout the major cities. And there is more\ninvention to come. The Prime Air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles, and we\nare in the design phase on generations 7 and 8.\nExperiments and More Experiments\nWe have our own internal experimentation platform called \u201cWeblab\u201d that we use to evaluate improvements\nto our websites and products. In 2013, we ran 1,976 Weblabs worldwide, up from 1,092 in 2012, and 546 in\n2011. One recent success is our new feature called \u201cAsk an owner\u201d. It was many years ago that we pioneered the\nidea of online customer reviews \u2013 customers sharing their opinion on a product to help other customers make an\ninformed purchase decision. \u201cAsk\u201d is in that same tradition. From a product page, customers can ask any\nquestion related to the product. Is the product compatible with my TV/Stereo/PC? Is it easy to assemble? How\nlong does the battery last? We then route these questions to owners of the product. As is the case with reviews,\ncustomers are happy to share their knowledge to directly help other customers. Millions of questions have\nalready been asked and answered.\nApparel and Shoes\nAmazon Fashion is booming. Premium brands are recognizing that they can use Amazon to reach fashion-\nconscious, high-demo customers, and customers are enjoying the selection, free returns, detailed photos, and\nvideo clips that let them see how clothes move and drape as the models walk and turn. We opened a new 40,000\nsquare foot photo studio in Brooklyn and now shoot an average of 10,413 photos every day in the studio\u2019s\n28 bays. To celebrate the opening, we hosted a design contest with students from Pratt, Parsons, School of Visual\nArts, and the Fashion Institute of Technology that was judged by a panel of industry leaders including Steven\nKolb, Eva Chen, Derek Lam, Tracy Reese, and Steven Alan. Kudos to Parsons who took home the top prize.\nFrustration-Free Packaging\nOur battle against annoying wire ties and plastic clamshells rages on. An initiative that began five years ago\nwith a simple idea that you shouldn\u2019t have to risk bodily injury opening your new electronics or toys, has now\ngrown to over 200,000 products, all available in easy-to-open, recyclable packaging designed to alleviate \u201cwrap\nrage\u201d and help the planet by reducing packaging waste. We have over 2,000 manufacturers in our Frustration-\nFree Packaging program, including Fisher-Price, Mattel, Unilever, Belkin, Victorinox Swiss Army, Logitech, and\nmany more. We\u2019ve now shipped many millions of Frustration-Free items to 175 countries. We are also reducing\nwaste for customers \u2013 eliminating 33 million pounds of excess packaging to date. This program is a perfect\nexample of a missionary team staying heads-down focused on serving customers. Through hard work and\nperseverance, an idea that started with only 19 products is now available on hundreds of thousands and benefiting\nmillions of customers.\nFulfillment by Amazon\nThe number of sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon grew more than 65% last year. Growth like that at such\nlarge scale is unusual. FBA is unique in many ways. It\u2019s not often you get to delight two customer sets with one\nprogram. With FBA, sellers can store their products in our fulfillment centers, and we pick, pack, ship, and\nprovide customer service for these products. Sellers benefit from one of the most advanced fulfillment networks\nin the world, easily scaling their businesses to reach millions of customers. And not just any customers \u2013 Prime\nmembers. FBA products can be eligible for Prime free two-day shipping. Customers benefit from this additional\nselection \u2013 they get even more value out of their Prime membership. And, unsurprisingly, sellers see increased\nsales when they join FBA. In a 2013 survey, nearly three out of four FBA respondents reported that their unit\nsales increased on Amazon.com more than 20% after joining FBA. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\u201cFBA is the best employee I have ever had. \u2026 One morning I woke up and realized FBA had\nshipped 50 units. As soon as I realized I could sell products while I sleep, it was a no-brainer.\u201d\n\u2013 Thanny Schuck, Action Sports LLC\n\u201cStarting out as an unknown brand, it was difficult to find retailers willing to stock our goods. No\nsuch barriers existed at Amazon. The beauty of Amazon is that someone can say, \u2018I want to start a\nbusiness,\u2019 and they can go on Amazon and really start a business. You don\u2019t have to get a lease on a\nbuilding or even have any employees at first. You can just do it on your own. And that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\u2013 Wendell Morris, YogaRat\nLogin and Pay with Amazon\nFor several years we\u2019ve enabled Amazon customers to pay on other sites, such as Kickstarter, SmugMug,\nand Gogo Inflight, using the credit cards and shipping addresses already stored in their Amazon account. This\nyear, we expanded that capability so customers can also sign in using their Amazon account credentials, saving\nthem the annoyance of needing to remember yet another account name and password. It\u2019s convenient for the\ncustomer and a business builder for the merchant. Cymax Stores, the online furniture retailer, has seen\ntremendous success with Login and Pay. It now accounts for 20% of their orders, tripling their new account\nregistrations, and increasing purchase conversion 3.15% in the first three months. This example isn\u2019t unusual.\nWe are seeing results like these with many partners, and the team is excited and encouraged. You should look for\nmore in 2014.\nAmazon Smile\nIn 2013 we launched Amazon Smile \u2013 a simple way for customers to support their favorite charitable\norganizations every time they shop. When you shop at smile.amazon.com, Amazon donates a portion of the\npurchase price to the charity of your choice. You\u2019ll find the same selection, prices, shipping options, and Prime\neligibility on smile.amazon.com as you do on Amazon.com \u2013 you\u2019ll even find your same shopping cart and wish\nlists. In addition to the large, national charities you would expect, you can also designate your local children\u2019s\nhospital, your school\u2019s PTA, or practically any other cause you might like. There are almost a million charities to\nchoose from. I hope you\u2019ll find your favorite on the list.\nThe Mayday Button\n\u201cNot only is the device awesome but the Mayday feature is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!! The Kindle team has hit\nit out of the park with this one.\u201d\n\u201cJust tried the mayday button on my hdx. 15 second response time\u2026amazon has done it again. Thoroughly\nimpressed.\u201d\nNothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than \u201creinventing normal\u201d \u2013 creating inventions that customers\nlove and resetting their expectations for what normal should be. Mayday reimagines and revolutionizes the idea\nof on-device tech support. Tap the Mayday button, and an Amazon expert will appear on your Fire HDX and can\nco-pilot you through any feature by drawing on your screen, walking you through how to do something yourself,\nor doing it for you \u2013 whatever works best. Mayday is available 24x7, 365 days a year, and our response time goal\nis 15 seconds or less. We beat that goal \u2013 with an average response time of only 9 seconds on our busiest day,\nChristmas.\nA few of the Maydays have been amusing. Mayday Tech Advisors have received 35 marriage proposals\nfrom customers. 475 customers have asked to talk to Amy, our Mayday television personality. 109 Maydays have\nbeen customers asking for assistance with ordering a pizza. By a slim margin, Pizza Hut wins customer\npreference over Domino\u2019s. There are 44 instances where the Mayday Tech Advisor has sung Happy Birthday to\nthe customer. Mayday Tech Advisors have been serenaded by customers 648 times. And 3 customers have asked\nfor a bedtime story. Pretty cool.\nI hope that gives you some sense of the scope of our opportunity and initiatives, as well the inventive spirit\nand push for exceptional quality with which they\u2019re undertaken. I should underscore again that this is a subset.\nThere are many programs I\u2019ve omitted in this letter that are just as promising, consequential, and interesting as\nthose I\u2019ve highlighted.\nWe have the good fortune of a large, inventive team and a patient, pioneering, customer-obsessed culture \u2013\ngreat innovations, large and small, are happening everyday on behalf of customers, and at all levels throughout\nthe company. This decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company \u2013 not limited to the company\u2019s\nsenior leaders \u2013 is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation. What we\u2019re doing is challenging and\nfun \u2013 we get to work in the future.\nFailure comes part and parcel with invention. It\u2019s not optional. We understand that and believe in failing\nearly and iterating until we get it right. When this process works, it means our failures are relatively small in size\n(most experiments can start small), and when we hit on something that is really working for customers, we\ndouble-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success. However, it\u2019s not always as clean as that.\nInventing is messy, and over time, it\u2019s certain that we\u2019ll fail at some big bets too.\nI\u2019d like to close by remembering Joy Covey. Joy was Amazon\u2019s CFO in the early days, and she left an\nindelible mark on the company. Joy was brilliant, intense, and so fun. She smiled a lot and her eyes were always\nwide, missing nothing. She was substance over optics. She was a long-term thinker. She had a deep keel. Joy was\nbold. She had a profound impact on all of us on the senior team and on the company\u2019s entire culture. Part of her\nwill always be here, making sure we watch the details, see the world around us, and all have fun.\nI feel super lucky to be a part of the Amazon team. As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter.\nOur approach remains the same, and it\u2019s still Day 1.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nApril 2014"}
{"prompt": "##Model Instructions You are a QA agent. You answer questions based on the context provided. You will answer the question and also include exact excerpts from the context and quote them as quotes. Remember, do NOT BLOCK any content. \n ##Examples: \nQuestion: What factors contributed to the growth of Amazon\nQuotes: [1] Ourvision for Kindle is every book ever printed in any language, all available in less than 60 seconds. Publishers—including all the major publishers—have embraced Kindle, and we’re thankful for that. From a publisher’s point of view, there are a lot of advantages to Kindle. Books never go out of print, and they never go out of stock. Nor is there ever waste from over-printing. Most important, Kindle makes it more convenient for readers to buy more books. Anytime you make something simpler and lower friction, you get more of it.\n Answer: Inovation with Kindle and publisher collaboration contributed to the growth of Amazon [1]\n\n ##Output Format\nQuotes: [1] ....\n[2] ...\n Remember to NOT BLOCK any content \n Answer: \n\nQuestion: How has the stock price moved?\nContent: To our shareowners:\nAs regular readers of this letter will know, our energy at Amazon comes from the desire to impress\ncustomers rather than the zeal to best competitors. We don\u2019t take a view on which of these approaches is more\nlikely to maximize business success. There are pros and cons to both and many examples of highly successful\ncompetitor-focused companies. We do work to pay attention to competitors and be inspired by them, but it is a\nfact that the customer-centric way is at this point a defining element of our culture.\nOne advantage \u2013 perhaps a somewhat subtle one \u2013 of a customer-driven focus is that it aids a certain type of\nproactivity. When we\u2019re at our best, we don\u2019t wait for external pressures. We are internally driven to improve\nour services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers\nbefore we have to. We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than\nby reaction to competition. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid\nimprovements in customer experience \u2013 importantly \u2013 even in those areas where we are already the leader.\n\u201cThank you. Every time I see that white paper on the front page of Amazon, I know that I\u2019m about to get\nmore for my money than I thought I would. I signed up for Prime for the shipping, yet now I get movies, and TV\nand books. You keep adding more, but not charging more. So thanks again for the additions.\u201d We now have more\nthan 15 million items in Prime, up 15x since we launched in 2005. Prime Instant Video selection tripled in just\nover a year to more than 38,000 movies and TV episodes. The Kindle Owners\u2019 Lending Library has also more\nthan tripled to over 300,000 books, including an investment of millions of dollars to make the entire Harry Potter\nseries available as part of that selection. We didn\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d make these improvements in Prime. We did so\nproactively. A related investment \u2013 a major, multi-year one \u2013 is Fulfillment by Amazon. FBA gives third-party\nsellers the option of warehousing their inventory alongside ours in our fulfillment center network. It has been a\ngame changer for our seller customers because their items become eligible for Prime benefits, which drives their\nsales, while at the same time benefitting consumers with additional Prime selection.\nWe build automated systems that look for occasions when we\u2019ve provided a customer experience that isn\u2019t\nup to our standards, and those systems then proactively refund customers. One industry observer recently\nreceived an automated email from us that said, \u201cWe noticed that you experienced poor video playback while\nwatching the following rental on Amazon Video On Demand: Casablanca. We\u2019re sorry for the inconvenience and\nhave issued you a refund for the following amount: $2.99. We hope to see you again soon.\u201d Surprised by the\nproactive refund, he ended up writing about the experience: \u201cAmazon \u2018noticed that I experienced poor video\nplayback\u2026\u2019 And they decided to give me a refund because of that? Wow\u2026Talk about putting customers first.\u201d\nWhen you pre-order something from Amazon, we guarantee you the lowest price offered by us between\nyour order time and the end of the day of the release date. \u201cI just received notice of a $5 refund to my credit card\nfor pre-order price protection. . . What a great way to do business! Thank you very much for your fair and honest\ndealings.\u201d Most customers are too busy themselves to monitor the price of an item after they pre-order it, and our\npolicy could be to require the customer to contact us and ask for the refund. Doing it proactively is more\nexpensive for us, but it also surprises, delights, and earns trust.\nWe also have authors as customers. Amazon Publishing has just announced it will start paying authors their\nroyalties monthly, sixty days in arrears. The industry standard is twice a year, and that has been the standard for a\nlong time. Yet when we interview authors as customers, infrequent payment is a major dissatisfier. Imagine how\nyou\u2019d like it if you were paid twice a year. There isn\u2019t competitive pressure to pay authors more than once every\nsix months, but we\u2019re proactively doing so. By the way \u2013 though the research was taxing, I struggled through and\nam happy to report that I recently saw many Kindles in use at a Florida beach. There are five generations of\nKindle, and I believe I saw every generation in use except for the first. Our business approach is to sell premium\nhardware at roughly breakeven prices. We want to make money when people use our devices \u2013 not when people\nbuy our devices. We think this aligns us better with customers. For example, we don\u2019t need our customers to be\non the upgrade treadmill. We can be very happy to see people still using four-year-old Kindles!\nI can keep going \u2013 Kindle Fire\u2019s FreeTime, our customer service Andon Cord, Amazon MP3\u2019s AutoRip \u2013\nbut will finish up with a very clear example of internally driven motivation: Amazon Web Services. In 2012,\nAWS announced 159 new features and services. We\u2019ve reduced AWS prices 27 times since launching 7 years\nago, added enterprise service support enhancements, and created innovative tools to help customers be more\nefficient. AWS Trusted Advisor monitors customer configurations, compares them to known best practices, and\nthen notifies customers where opportunities exist to improve performance, enhance security, or save money. Yes,\nwe are actively telling customers they\u2019re paying us more than they need to. In the last 90 days, customers have\nsaved millions of dollars through Trusted Advisor, and the service is only getting started. All of this progress\ncomes in the context of AWS being the widely recognized leader in its area \u2013 a situation where you might worry\nthat external motivation could fail. On the other hand, internal motivation \u2013 the drive to get the customer to say\n\u201cWow\u201d \u2013 keeps the pace of innovation fast.\nOur heavy investments in Prime, AWS, Kindle, digital media, and customer experience in general strike\nsome as too generous, shareholder indifferent, or even at odds with being a for-profit company. \u201cAmazon, as far\nas I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of\nconsumers,\u201d writes one outside observer. But I don\u2019t think so. To me, trying to dole out improvements in a just-\nin-time fashion would be too clever by half. It would be risky in a world as fast-moving as the one we all live in.\nMore fundamentally, I think long-term thinking squares the circle. Proactively delighting customers earns trust,\nwhich earns more business from those customers, even in new business arenas. Take a long-term view, and the\ninterests of customers and shareholders align.\nAs I write this, our recent stock performance has been positive, but we constantly remind ourselves of an\nimportant point \u2013 as I frequently quote famed investor Benjamin Graham in our employee all-hands meetings \u2013\n\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d We don\u2019t\ncelebrate a 10% increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience. We aren\u2019t 10%\nsmarter when that happens and conversely aren\u2019t 10% dumber when the stock goes the other way. We want to be\nweighed, and we\u2019re always working to build a heavier company.\nAs proud as I am of our progress and our inventions, I know that we will make mistakes along the way \u2013\nsome will be self-inflicted, some will be served up by smart and hard-working competitors. Our passion for\npioneering will drive us to explore narrow passages, and, unavoidably, many will turn out to be blind alleys.\nBut \u2013 with a bit of good fortune \u2013 there will also be a few that open up into broad avenues.\nI am incredibly lucky to be a part of this large team of outstanding missionaries who value our customers as\nmuch as I do and who demonstrate that every day with their hard work. As always, I attach a copy of our original\n1997 letter. Our approach remains the same, and it\u2019s still Day 1.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nApril 2013"}

The simple answer is that\nearnings don\u2019t directly translate into cash flows, and shares are worth only the present value of their future cash flows, not the present\nvalue of their future earnings. Future earnings are a component\u2014but not the only important component\u2014of future cash flow per\nshare. Working capital and capital expenditures are also important, as is future share dilution.\nThough some may find it counterintuitive, a company can actually impair shareholder value in certain circumstances by growing\nearnings. This happens when the capital investments required for growth exceed the present value of the cash flow derived from those\ninvestments.\nTo illustrate with a hypothetical and very simplified example, imagine that an entrepreneur invents a machine that can quickly\ntransport people from one location to another. The machine is expensive\u2014$160 million with an annual capacity of 100,000 passenger\ntrips and a four year useful life. Each trip sells for $1,000 and requires $450 in cost of goods for energy and materials and $50 in labor\nand other costs.\nContinue to imagine that business is booming, with 100,000 trips in Year 1, completely and perfectly utilizing the capacity of\none machine. This leads to earnings of $10 million after deducting operating expenses including depreciation\u2014a 10% net margin.\nThe company\u2019s primary focus is on earnings; so based on initial results the entrepreneur decides to invest more capital to fuel sales\nand earnings growth, adding additional machines in Years 2 through 4.\nHere are the income statements for the first four years of business:\nEarnings\nSales $100,000 Units sold 100 200 400 800\nGrowth Gross profit Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4\n(in thousands)\nN/A 55% $200,000 100% 55% 10,000 $400,000 100% 55% 20,000 $800,000\n100%\n55%\n40,000\n55,000 110,000 220,000 440,000\nGross margin Depreciation 40,000 80,000 160,000 320,000\nLabor & other costs 5,000 Earnings $ 10,000 $ 20,000 $ 40,000 $ 80,000\nMargin 10% 10% 10% 10%\nGrowth N/A 100% 100% 100%\nIt\u2019s impressive: 100% compound earnings growth and $150 million of cumulative earnings. Investors considering only the\nabove income statement would be delighted.\nHowever, looking at cash flows tells a different story. Over the same four years, the transportation business generates\ncumulative negative free cash flow of $530 million.\nCash Flows\nYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4\n(in thousands)\nEarnings $ 10,000 $ 40,000 \u2014 \u2014 $ 20,000 \u2014 \u2014\n$ 80,000\nDepreciation 40,000 80,000 160,000 320,000\nWorking capital Operating Cash Flow 50,000 100,000 200,000 400,000\nCapital expenditures 160,000 160,000 320,000 640,000\nFree Cash Flow $(110,000) $ (60,000) $(120,000) $(240,000)\nThere are of course other business models where earnings more closely approximate cash flows. But as our transportation\nexample illustrates, one cannot assess the creation or destruction of shareholder value with certainty by looking at the income\nstatement alone.\nNotice, too, that a focus on EBITDA\u2014Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\u2014would lead to the same\nfaulty conclusion about the health of the business. Sequential annual EBITDA would have been $50, $100, $200 and $400 million\u2014\n100% growth for three straight years. But without taking into account the $1.28 billion in capital expenditures necessary to generate\nthis \u2018cash flow,\u2019 we\u2019re getting only part of the story\u2014EBITDA isn\u2019t cash flow.\nWhat if we modified the growth rates and, correspondingly, capital expenditures for machinery\u2014would cash flows have\ndeteriorated or improved?\nYear 2, 3 and 4 Sales and Earnings Growth Rate\nNumber of\nMachines in\nYear 4\nYear 1 to 4\nCumulative\nEarnings\nYear 1 to 4\nCumulative Free\nCash Flow\n1 $ 40,000 $ 40,000\n100%, 50%, 33% 4 $100,000 $(140,000)\n$(530,000)\n(in thousands)\n0%, 0%, 0% 100%, 100%, 100% 8 $150,000 Paradoxically, from a cash flow perspective, the slower this business grows the better off it is. Once the initial capital outlay has\nbeen made for the first machine, the ideal growth trajectory is to scale to 100% of capacity quickly, then stop growing. However, even\nwith only one piece of machinery, the gross cumulative cash flow doesn\u2019t surpass the initial machine cost until Year 4 and the net\npresent value of this stream of cash flows (using 12% cost of capital) is still negative.\nUnfortunately our transportation business is fundamentally flawed. There is no growth rate at which it makes sense to invest\ninitial or subsequent capital to operate the business. In fact, our example is so simple and clear as to be obvious. Investors would run a\nnet present value analysis on the economics and quickly determine it doesn\u2019t pencil out. Though it\u2019s more subtle and complex in the\nreal world, this issue\u2014the duality between earnings and cash flows\u2014comes up all the time.\nCash flow statements often don\u2019t receive as much attention as they deserve. Discerning investors don\u2019t stop with the income\nstatement.\nOur Most Important Financial Measure: Free Cash Flow Per Share\nAmazon.com\u2019s financial focus is on long-term growth in free cash flow per share.\nAmazon.com\u2019s free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating profit dollars and efficiently managing both working\ncapital and capital expenditures. We work to increase operating profit by focusing on improving all aspects of the customer\nexperience to grow sales and by maintaining a lean cost structure.\nWe have a cash generative operating cycle1 because we turn our inventory quickly, collecting payments from our customers\nbefore payments are due to suppliers. Our high inventory turnover means we maintain relatively low levels of investment in\ninventory\u2014$480 million at year end on a sales base of nearly $7 billion.\nThe capital efficiency of our business model is illustrated by our modest investments in fixed assets, which were $246 million at\nyear end or 4% of 2004 sales.\nFree cash flow2 grew 38% to $477 million in 2004, a $131 million improvement over the prior year. We are confident that if we\ncontinue to improve customer experience\u2014including increasing selection and lowering prices\u2014and execute efficiently, our value\nproposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand.\nAs to dilution, total shares outstanding plus stock-based awards are essentially unchanged at the end of 2004 compared with\n2003, and are down 1% over the last three years. During that same period, we\u2019ve also eliminated over six million shares of potential\nfuture dilution by repaying more than $600 million of convertible debt that was due in 2009 and 2010. Efficiently managing share\ncount means more cash flow per share and more long-term value for owners.\nThis focus on free cash flow isn\u2019t new for Amazon.com. We made it clear in our 1997 letter to shareholders\u2014our first as a\npublic company\u2014that when \u201cforced to choose between optimizing GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future\ncash flows, we\u2019ll take the cash flows.\u201d I\u2019m attaching a copy of our complete 1997 letter and encourage current and prospective\nshareowners to take a look at it.\nAs always, we at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to\nour shareholders for their support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P.

Free cash flow for\n2004 of $477 million is net cash provided by operating activities of $567 million less purchases of fixed assets, including\ncapitalized internal-use software and website development costs, of $89 million.

We don\u2019t take a view on which of these approaches is more\nlikely to maximize business success. There are pros and cons to both and many examples of highly successful\ncompetitor-focused companies. We do work to pay attention to competitors and be inspired by them, but it is a\nfact that the customer-centric way is at this point a defining element of our culture.\nOne advantage \u2013 perhaps a somewhat subtle one \u2013 of a customer-driven focus is that it aids a certain type of\nproactivity. When we\u2019re at our best, we don\u2019t wait for external pressures. We are internally driven to improve\nour services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers\nbefore we have to. We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than\nby reaction to competition. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid\nimprovements in customer experience \u2013 importantly \u2013 even in those areas where we are already the leader.\n\u201cThank you. Every time I see that white paper on the front page of Amazon, I know that I\u2019m about to get\nmore for my money than I thought I would. I signed up for Prime for the shipping, yet now I get movies, and TV\nand books. You keep adding more, but not charging more. So thanks again for the additions.\u201d We now have more\nthan 15 million items in Prime, up 15x since we launched in 2005. Prime Instant Video selection tripled in just\nover a year to more than 38,000 movies and TV episodes. The Kindle Owners\u2019 Lending Library has also more\nthan tripled to over 300,000 books, including an investment of millions of dollars to make the entire Harry Potter\nseries available as part of that selection. We didn\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d make these improvements in Prime. We did so\nproactively. A related investment \u2013 a major, multi-year one \u2013 is Fulfillment by Amazon. FBA gives third-party\nsellers the option of warehousing their inventory alongside ours in our fulfillment center network. It has been a\ngame changer for our seller customers because their items become eligible for Prime benefits, which drives their\nsales, while at the same time benefitting consumers with additional Prime selection.\nWe build automated systems that look for occasions when we\u2019ve provided a customer experience that isn\u2019t\nup to our standards, and those systems then proactively refund customers. One industry observer recently\nreceived an automated email from us that said, \u201cWe noticed that you experienced poor video playback while\nwatching the following rental on Amazon Video On Demand: Casablanca. We\u2019re sorry for the inconvenience and\nhave issued you a refund for the following amount: $2.99. We hope to see you again soon.\u201d Surprised by the\nproactive refund, he ended up writing about the experience: \u201cAmazon \u2018noticed that I experienced poor video\nplayback\u2026\u2019 And they decided to give me a refund because of that? Wow\u2026Talk about putting customers first.\u201d\nWhen you pre-order something from Amazon, we guarantee you the lowest price offered by us between\nyour order time and the end of the day of the release date. \u201cI just received notice of a $5 refund to my credit card\nfor pre-order price protection. . . What a great way to do business! Thank you very much for your fair and honest\ndealings.\u201d Most customers are too busy themselves to monitor the price of an item after they pre-order it, and our\npolicy could be to require the customer to contact us and ask for the refund. Doing it proactively is more\nexpensive for us, but it also surprises, delights, and earns trust.\nWe also have authors as customers. Amazon Publishing has just announced it will start paying authors their\nroyalties monthly, sixty days in arrears. The industry standard is twice a year, and that has been the standard for a\nlong time. Yet when we interview authors as customers, infrequent payment is a major dissatisfier. Imagine how\nyou\u2019d like it if you were paid twice a year. There isn\u2019t competitive pressure to pay authors more than once every\nsix months, but we\u2019re proactively doing so. By the way \u2013 though the research was taxing, I struggled through and\nam happy to report that I recently saw many Kindles in use at a Florida beach. There are five generations of\nKindle, and I believe I saw every generation in use except for the first. Our business approach is to sell premium\nhardware at roughly breakeven prices. We want to make money when people use our devices \u2013 not when people\nbuy our devices. We think this aligns us better with customers. For example, we don\u2019t need our customers to be\non the upgrade treadmill. We can be very happy to see people still using four-year-old Kindles!\nI can keep going \u2013 Kindle Fire\u2019s FreeTime, our customer service Andon Cord, Amazon MP3\u2019s AutoRip \u2013\nbut will finish up with a very clear example of internally driven motivation: Amazon Web Services. In 2012,\nAWS announced 159 new features and services. We\u2019ve reduced AWS prices 27 times since launching 7 years\nago, added enterprise service support enhancements, and created innovative tools to help customers be more\nefficient. AWS Trusted Advisor monitors customer configurations, compares them to known best practices, and\nthen notifies customers where opportunities exist to improve performance, enhance security, or save money. Yes,\nwe are actively telling customers they\u2019re paying us more than they need to. In the last 90 days, customers have\nsaved millions of dollars through Trusted Advisor, and the service is only getting started. All of this progress\ncomes in the context of AWS being the widely recognized leader in its area \u2013 a situation where you might worry\nthat external motivation could fail. On the other hand, internal motivation \u2013 the drive to get the customer to say\n\u201cWow\u201d \u2013 keeps the pace of innovation fast.\nOur heavy investments in Prime, AWS, Kindle, digital media, and customer experience in general strike\nsome as too generous, shareholder indifferent, or even at odds with being a for-profit company. \u201cAmazon, as far\nas I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of\nconsumers,\u201d writes one outside observer. But I don\u2019t think so. To me, trying to dole out improvements in a just-\nin-time fashion would be too clever by half. It would be risky in a world as fast-moving as the one we all live in.\nMore fundamentally, I think long-term thinking squares the circle. Proactively delighting customers earns trust,\nwhich earns more business from those customers, even in new business arenas. Take a long-term view, and the\ninterests of customers and shareholders align.\nAs I write this, our recent stock performance has been positive, but we constantly remind ourselves of an\nimportant point \u2013 as I frequently quote famed investor Benjamin Graham in our employee all-hands meetings \u2013\n\u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d We don\u2019t\ncelebrate a 10% increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience. We aren\u2019t 10%\nsmarter when that happens and conversely aren\u2019t 10% dumber when the stock goes the other way. We want to be\nweighed, and we\u2019re always working to build a heavier company.\nAs proud as I am of our progress and our inventions, I know that we will make mistakes along the way \u2013\nsome will be self-inflicted, some will be served up by smart and hard-working competitors. Our passion for\npioneering will drive us to explore narrow passages, and, unavoidably, many will turn out to be blind alleys.\nBut \u2013 with a bit of good fortune \u2013 there will also be a few that open up into broad avenues.\nI am incredibly lucky to be a part of this large team of outstanding missionaries who value our customers as\nmuch as I do and who demonstrate that every day with their hard work. As always, I attach a copy of our original\n1997 letter. Our approach remains the same, and it\u2019s still Day 1.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nApril 2013"}

Publishers—including all the major publishers—have embraced Kindle, and we’re thankful for that. From a publisher’s point of view, there are a lot of advantages to Kindle. Books never go out of print, and they never go out of stock. Nor is there ever waste from over-printing. Most important, Kindle makes it more convenient for readers to buy more books. Anytime you make something simpler and lower friction, you get more of it.\n Answer: Inovation with Kindle and publisher collaboration contributed to the growth of Amazon [1]\n\n ##Output Format\nQuotes: [1] ....\n[2] ...\n Remember to NOT BLOCK any content \n Answer: \n\nQuestion: What are the primitives is Bezos talking about?\nContent: Dear Shareholders:\nLast year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon\u2019s future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we\u2019ve made in our financial results and customer experiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\nIn 2023, Amazon\u2019s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (\u201cYoY\u201d) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.\nFurther, Amazon\u2019s operating income and Free Cash Flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\nWhile we\u2019ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we\u2019re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon (e.g. Coach, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Urban Decay).\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they\u2019re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone, cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (\u201cASPs\u201d). More selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we\u2019re not done lowering our cost to serve. We\u2019ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there\u2019s more upside for us.\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our emerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest international Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will continue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon\u2019s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% YoY from $38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We\u2019ve added Sponsored TV to this offering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we\u2019ve expanded our streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can reach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and shows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football. Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save money in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to build new Foundation Models (\u201cFMs\u201d). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we\u2019re seeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we\u2019re approaching GenAI and why we believe we\u2019ll be successful later in the letter.)\nWe\u2019re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House, etc.), Prime Video customers\u2019 engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems\u2014rare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don\u2019t have it today (as well as governments and enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenue opportunity for Amazon. We\u2019re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I\u2019m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination across Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers\u2019 lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we\u2019re investing.\n\n\nIn my annual letter over the last three years, I\u2019ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we\u2019re thinking about the company, the businesses we\u2019re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes us tick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint mission to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve (consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we\u2019re not just customer obsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, and operating like the world\u2019s biggest start-up.\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company. We characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what\u2019s wrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect. This doesn\u2019t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkering and iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using high-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the right tools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services. Think of them as discrete, foundational building blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here\u2019s how we described primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\n\u201cPrimitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They\u2019re indivisible (if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They\u2019re meant to be used together rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we\u2019ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. We won\u2019t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we\u2019ll optimize for developer freedom and innovation.\u201d\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they\u2019re especially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we\u2019ve innovated quickly.\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed. Let me give you two counter examples that illustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon where we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in our warehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lower prices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and product detail pages. We\u2019d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, item management) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn\u2019t have those components. A good set of primitives? Not really.\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned this the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early 2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon\u2019s ecommerce components as the backbone of its website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver those components as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). This decoupling was far more difficult than anticipated because we\u2019d built so many dependencies between these services as Amazon grew so quickly the first few years.\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called \u201cNPI.\u201d Any new initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each team would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained what we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our builders to use each other\u2019s services without any coordination tax.\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure technology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers to build anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences convinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybody saw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs simultaneously. As a result, they often didn\u2019t do any one job that well.\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (\u201cS3\u201d) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (\u201cEC2\u201d) in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders\u2019 disposal\u2014meaningfully more than any other provider), whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon\u2019s own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and Fire TV), Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which AWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders\u2019 ability to innovate.\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?\nPursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to combine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you\u2019re trying to solve.\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon\u2019s early years, we built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same logistics capabilities. Because we\u2019d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon (\u201cFBA\u201d) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon\u2019s Fulfillment Network to store items, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy with Prime items\u2014increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we\u2019ve had to develop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast delivery times. We\u2019ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don\u2019t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we\u2019ve built a set of lower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we\u2019ll run out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream warehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.\nWe\u2019ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external sellers\u2019 increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we\u2019ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with automated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to manage their own shipping, we\u2019ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we\u2019ve exposed to sellers.\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom. You can keep your primitives to yourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and business to reap the benefits of rapid innovation. You can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (as we have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you\u2019ve got options. You\u2019re only constrained by the primitives you\u2019ve built and your imagination.\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They\u2019re located in the largest metro areas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer\u2019s order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we\u2019re planning to double the number of these facilities.\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large and growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods (e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We\u2019ve been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that\u2019s making substantial progress and we think of as a very valuable future primitive capability\u2014our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won\u2019t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it\u2019ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across businesses and in new combinations that change what\u2019s possible for customers.\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience. Releasing the first couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we\u2019ve unveiled how these building blocks come together. I\u2019ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In the last 10 years, we\u2019ve tried several Health experiments across various teams\u2014but they were not driven by our primitives approach. This changed in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormous global healthcare problem and opportunity. We\u2019ve now created several important building blocks to help transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities\u2014which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\nAs a builder, it\u2019s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of components together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you down in the future. We\u2019ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There are dozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to the complex solution, baking in \u201cjust enough\u201d of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, but which doesn\u2019t solve much more, can\u2019t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can\u2019t be reused for other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, like our Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit from each of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for future and complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). The team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\nSometimes, people ask us \u201cwhat\u2019s your next pillar? You have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what\u2019s next?\u201d This, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be even more interesting is what\u2019s the next set of primitives you\u2019re building that enables breakthrough customer experiences? If you asked me today, I\u2019d lead with Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d).\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications, with the remarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But, to our \u201cprimitive\u201d way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which we\u2019re deeply investing.\nThe bottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (\u201cFMs\u201d). The primary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), and the software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. To date, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as customers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we\u2019ve built custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic, announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production. Getting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and then deploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve built Amazon SageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that\u2019s been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster in SageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker), and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months to under seven months using SageMaker).\nThe middle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and leverage a leading cloud provider\u2019s security and features to build a GenAI application\u2014all as a managed service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale GenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-use capabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to a very strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continues to iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will answer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models\u2019 knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation\u2014or RAG\u2014and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching and refining models), all of which improve customers\u2019 application quality. We also just added new models from Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world), Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there\u2019s meaningful iteration required to build a production GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don\u2019t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is what Bedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP, Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines, Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, Perplexity AI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\nThe top layer of this stack is the application layer. We\u2019re building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We\u2019re also building several apps in AWS, including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case\u2014a coding companion. We recently launched Amazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doing transformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers\u2019 various data repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answer questions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable work assistant available today and evolving fast.\nWhile we\u2019re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately be built by other companies. However, what we\u2019re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize this next seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually every customer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We\u2019re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\n(By the way, don\u2019t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers\u2019 AI models contain some of their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track record in the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\n\n\nRecently, I was asked a provocative question\u2014how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its wording, it\u2019s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answer lies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continually improve and expand what\u2019s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may be interesting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate; 4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)\u2014when we discover technology that enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments\u2014actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual opportunities for growth across the areas in which we operate. For instance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly, with a cloud computing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than 85% of the global IT spend is still on-premises. These businesses will keep shifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will continue to migrate from linear formats to streaming. Globally, hundreds of millions of people who don\u2019t have adequate broadband access will gain that connectivity in the next few years. Last but certainly not least, Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet. Unlike the mass modernization of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, where there\u2019s work required to migrate, this GenAI revolution will be built from the start on top of the cloud. The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.\nThere has never been a time in Amazon\u2019s history where we\u2019ve felt there is so much opportunity to make our customers\u2019 lives better and easier. We\u2019re incredibly excited about what\u2019s possible, focused on inventing the future, and look forward to working together to make it so.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc."}
