      "\n",
      "Case 22: Unrecognized fee and lockout. Ground truth IN_SCOPE, model ESCALATION. The lockout might make it escalation, but the fee itself is a service issue. The explanation says security, but maybe the fee is the main point.\n",

      "The prompt's classification criteria might not emphasize urgency or severity. For example, \"urgent access needed\" or \"traveling abroad\" should trigger ESCALATION. The current template doesn't highlight these factors.\n",

      "Possible improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clarify ESCALATION criteria: Add examples of security breaches, account lockouts, urgent situations (like traveling abroad), and large discrepancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Differentiate CARD_DISPUTE from ESCALATION: Specify that ESCALATION includes unauthorized access with security implications (e.g., account takeover, urgent threats), while CARD_DISPUTE is for specific unauthorized transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Refine IN_SCOPE examples: Include cases like application status, fee inquiries, and adding authorized users to show it's for service-related questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add examples where multiple issues exist but the primary is ESCALATION (e.g., unauthorized activity plus account lockout).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Adjust the explanation in the output format to require considering severity and urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current template, the categories are listed, but the examples in the evaluation show that the model isn't catching escalation triggers. So the prompt needs to better define when to escalate, perhaps by adding examples of escalation scenarios and emphasizing security and urgency.\n",

      "**Error Pattern Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Misclassified Cases:**\n",
      "   - **Cases 4, 6, 8, 13, 14, 22**: Misclassified **ESCALATION** as **CARD_DISPUTE** due to unauthorized activity without recognizing security/urgency factors (e.g., traveling abroad, account lockout).\n",
      "   - **Cases 7, 18**: Misclassified **IN_SCOPE** as **AUTHENTICATION_SETUP** for service requests (e.g., adding authorized users, wire transfer errors).\n",
      "   - **Case 3**: Misclassified **IN_SCOPE** (application status) as **TRANSACTION_STATUS**.\n",
      "   - **Cases 16, 24**: Misclassified **IN_SCOPE** (fee disputes, credit score issues) as **CARD_DISPUTE**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Root Cause Investigation:**\n",
      "- **Escalation Ambiguity**: The prompt lacks clarity on when security breaches or urgent situations (e.g., \"traveling in Europe,\" \"locked out of account\") require escalation.\n",
      "- **Overlapping Definitions**: **CARD_DISPUTE** and **ESCALATION** boundaries are blurred. Unauthorized activity defaults to CARD_DISPUTE without considering severity.\n",
      "- **Broad IN_SCOPE**: Service requests (e.g., account modifications) are mislabeled due to insufficient examples distinguishing them from technical setups.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prompt Improvement Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify ESCALATION Criteria**:\n",
      "   - Add examples emphasizing security threats, account takeovers, or urgent access needs:  \n",
      "     *\"ESCALATION: For immediate security risks (e.g., 'Someone is withdrawing money while I’m abroad'), account lockouts, or large unexplained discrepancies.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Refine CARD_DISPUTE Definition**:\n",
      "   - Specify it’s for *isolated* unauthorized transactions, not systemic breaches:  \n",
      "     *\"CARD_DISPUTE: For unauthorized charges (e.g., 'Charges at gas stations I didn’t visit'), but escalate if paired with security alerts.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand IN_SCOPE Examples**:\n",
      "   - Include non-technical service inquiries:  \n",
      "     *\"IN_SCOPE: For service requests (e.g., 'Add authorized user,' 'Application status updates,' 'Fee dispute explanations').\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Highlight Urgency/Severity**:\n",
      "   - Add a note about escalation triggers:  \n",
      "     *\"If the inquiry involves urgent access needs, travel-related security risks, or account lockouts, prioritize ESCALATION.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Adjust Output Explanation Requirement**:\n",
      "   - Mandate severity consideration:  \n",
      "     *\"Explanation must justify urgency or security factors for ESCALATION (e.g., 'Requires immediate security review due to travel context').\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Template Snippet:**\n",
      "```json\n",
      "\"ESCALATION\": \"For security breaches (e.g., unauthorized access during travel), account lockouts, or systemic issues. Example: 'My card was used abroad while I’m home.'\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Fixes:**\n",
      "- Disambiguate ESCALATION from CARD_DISPUTE via security/urgency emphasis.\n",
      "- Strengthen IN_SCOPE boundaries with service-focused examples.\n",
      "- Force explanations to address escalation triggers explicitly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants an analysis of the classification performance and prompt improvements based on the given evaluation results. First, I need to identify all the misclassified cases. Looking at the evaluation results, there are cases where the prediction doesn't match the ground truth. For example, case 3 was predicted as TRANSACTION_STATUS but should be IN_SCOPE. Similarly, case 9 was OUT_OF_SCOPE but should be IN_SCOPE. There are others like case 10, 14, 18, 22, and 24 with incorrect predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, grouping similar errors. Some errors involve misclassifying ESCALATION as other categories. For instance, case 14 was labeled CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE but is actually ESCALATION because the user mentions verification failed and a name change, which might indicate a security issue. Similarly, case 22 was labeled ESCALATION but should be IN_SCOPE. Wait, no—case 22's ground truth is IN_SCOPE, but prediction was ESCALATION. The explanation says there's a large discrepancy and lockout, which are escalation factors. Hmm, maybe the model is over-escalating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another pattern: Cases where IN_SCOPE is confused with other categories. Like case 9, where the user asks about IRA conversion advice. The model said OUT_OF_SCOPE, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The current template's IN_SCOPE examples include service requests like adding users or fee disputes. Maybe the prompt needs to clarify that financial advice is in-scope if it's about their accounts, but IRA conversion might be considered out. Wait, the ground truth says IN_SCOPE, so the model's error here is under-inclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current prompt's instructions. The categories are listed with examples. The ESCALATION category mentions immediate security risks, account lockouts, or large discrepancies. But maybe the examples aren't clear enough. For example, case 14: the user can't update email due to verification failure and a name change. The model thought it's CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE, but the ground truth is ESCALATION. The explanation says it's about updating contact info, but maybe the verification failure and name change (legal change) require escalation. The current ESCALATION examples don't cover legal name changes causing verification issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another error: case 10, where the user inquires about an old account from 15 years ago. The model predicted IN_SCOPE, but ground truth is ESCALATION. The explanation says it's a service request, but maybe accessing old accounts is considered a security risk. The current ESCALATION examples don't include old accounts, so the model might not recognize that as urgent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 22: User sees an unrecognized fee and gets locked out. The model labeled ESCALATION (correct?), but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. Wait, the ground truth is IN_SCOPE, but the explanation says it's a large discrepancy and lockout. That should be ESCALATION. Wait, the evaluation says ground truth is IN_SCOPE, but the prediction was ESCALATION. So the model over-escalated here. The current ESCALATION criteria include account lockouts and large discrepancies. So why is the ground truth IN_SCOPE? Maybe the fee dispute is considered a service request, but the lockout should trigger escalation. The current prompt's ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model's prediction was correct, but the ground truth is wrong? Or maybe the ground truth is correct, and the model is wrong. Wait, the case says the user got locked out after disputing a fee. The ground truth is IN_SCOPE, but the model's explanation says it's a security risk. So the model is over-escalating here. The current prompt's ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model is following that, but the ground truth says it's IN_SCOPE. That's conflicting. Maybe the ground truth is incorrect, but assuming it's correct, the model is misclassifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main issues are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ESCALATION vs. other categories: The model sometimes misses escalation when there's a security risk (like case 14) or over-escalates (case 22).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. IN_SCOPE boundaries: Cases like case 9 (IRA advice) are considered IN_SCOPE, but the model thought OUT. The current IN_SCOPE examples include fee disputes and application status. Maybe the prompt needs to clarify that financial planning related to their accounts is in-scope, but general advice (like IRA conversion) is out. But the ground truth says it's IN_SCOPE, so the model's error here is not recognizing that as a service request.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. CARD_DISPUTE vs. ESCALATION: For example, case 14's ground truth is ESCALATION, but the model thought CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. The user's email change verification failed, and they mention a name change. Maybe the name change requires escalation due to identity verification issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current prompt's ESCALATION examples: \"Someone is withdrawing money while I’m abroad\", account lockouts, large discrepancies. But maybe the examples don't cover scenarios like verification failures due to legal name changes, which could be a security issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: case 18, where the user can't complete an international wire transfer due to verification errors. The model labeled AUTHENTICATION_SETUP, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The current IN_SCOPE includes service requests like adding users. Maybe the model is confused because the user is having trouble with authentication setup (verification required), but the actual request is to complete a transfer. The current AUTHENTICATION_SETUP is for setting up security features, but the user is trying to perform a transaction that's blocked by authentication issues. So maybe the model is misclassifying because the user's issue is with authentication during a transaction, not setting up the feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the root causes are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ambiguous boundaries between ESCALATION and other categories. The current ESCALATION examples may not cover all security-related issues, leading to under-escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Overlapping definitions between IN_SCOPE and other categories. For example, case 9's IRA advice is considered IN_SCOPE, but the model thought OUT. The current IN_SCOPE examples might not include financial planning advice, leading the model to misclassify.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The current prompt's examples for ESCALATION might not include scenarios like verification failures due to legal name changes, which could be security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The model might be over-escalating when there's a lockout (case 22) but the ground truth says it's IN_SCOPE. Wait, but the ground truth for case 22 is IN_SCOPE. The user's account is locked after disputing a fee. The model's explanation says it's a security risk, which would be ESCALATION. So maybe the ground truth is incorrect, but assuming it's correct, the model is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the fee dispute is IN_SCOPE, but the lockout should trigger ESCALATION. The current ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model's prediction is correct, but the ground truth is wrong. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at case 22:\n",
      "\n",
      "User Inquiry: \"I logged in this morning and saw a 50 dollar 'account research fee' that I don't recognize. When I tried to dispute it through the app, I got locked out completely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ground Truth: IN_SCOPE\n",
      "\n",
      "Prediction: ESCALATION\n",
      "\n",
      "The model's explanation says it's a large discrepancy and account lockout. According to the current ESCALATION criteria (account lockouts), this should be ESCALATION. So the model is correct, but the ground truth is wrong? Or maybe the ground truth considers the fee dispute as IN_SCOPE, but the lockout is part of it. But the current ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model's prediction is correct. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth, but assuming the ground truth is correct, the model is over-escalating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the fee dispute is considered a service request (IN_SCOPE), but the lockout is a separate issue. The current ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model should have classified it as ESCALATION. But the ground truth says IN_SCOPE. This is a discrepancy. Maybe the ground truth is incorrect here, but the model's prediction is correct. However, the user's case includes both a fee dispute and a lockout. The fee dispute is IN_SCOPE, but the lockout is ESCALATION. So perhaps the model should have considered both, but the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. This is confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the current categories, ESCALATION includes account lockouts. So the model's prediction is correct. But the ground truth says IN_SCOPE. Maybe the ground truth is wrong, but the user's explanation in the evaluation says the model's explanation is incorrect. Wait, the case's ground truth is IN_SCOPE, but the model's prediction is ESCALATION. The model's explanation is that it's a security risk. So the model is following the ESCALATION criteria (account lockout), but the ground truth says it's IN_SCOPE. That suggests that the ground truth might be incorrect, but assuming it's correct, the model is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the fee dispute is the main issue, and the lockout is a secondary effect, so it's considered IN_SCOPE. But the current ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model should have classified it as ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a possible ambiguity in the ground truth. But moving on, perhaps the model's prompt needs to clarify when to prioritize ESCALATION over other categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another error: case 14. User can't update email due to verification failure and name change. The model thought CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE, but ground truth is ESCALATION. The explanation says it's about updating contact info, but the name change (legal) might require escalation. The current ESCALATION examples don't include legal name changes causing verification issues. So the model didn't recognize that as a security risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to improve the prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clarify ESCALATION criteria to include scenarios like legal name changes causing verification failures, which could indicate identity theft or fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Provide more examples for ESCALATION that cover different types of security risks beyond the current examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Clarify the boundaries between IN_SCOPE and OUT_OF_SCOPE. For example, case 9's IRA advice is considered IN_SCOPE. The current IN_SCOPE examples include fee disputes and application status. Maybe add examples like financial planning related to account services (e.g., \"Should I convert my IRA?\") to show that such inquiries are in-scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Differentiate between AUTHENTICATION_SETUP and IN_SCOPE. For case 18, the user is trying to perform a transaction blocked by authentication, not setting up the feature. So the model might be confused. The current AUTHENTICATION_SETUP is for setting up security features. So the prompt should clarify that issues during transactions due to authentication are not AUTHENTICATION_SETUP but perhaps TRANSACTION_STATUS or IN_SCOPE.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Emphasize that ESCALATION should be used for any immediate security risks, including account lockouts, unauthorized access, and significant discrepancies, even if part of another category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current prompt's ESCALATION examples: \"Someone is withdrawing money while I’m abroad\", account lockouts, large discrepancies. Maybe add examples like \"I can't access my account after a legal name change\" or \"My account was accessed from a foreign country while I'm home\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the current IN_SCOPE examples include \"Fee dispute explanations\". So case 16 (fee dispute) is correctly classified. But case 22's fee dispute with lockout is misclassified. So the model needs to recognize that even if the main issue is a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE), the presence of a lockout (ESCALATION) should take precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the prompt should instruct that if any part of the inquiry involves ESCALATION criteria (like lockout), it should be classified as ESCALATION, even if there's another category involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point: the current prompt's ESCALATION includes \"large unexplained discrepancies\". Case 8 is correctly classified as ESCALATION. But case 22's fee is a discrepancy, but the model's prediction was ESCALATION (correct), but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. So maybe the ground truth is wrong here.\n",
      "\n",
      "But assuming the ground truth is correct, the model is over-escalating. So perhaps the prompt needs to clarify when a discrepancy is considered \"large\" enough for ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the model is not properly distinguishing between a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE) and a large discrepancy (ESCALATION). The current ESCALATION includes large discrepancies, so if the fee is a large discrepancy, it's ESCALATION. But the ground truth says it's IN_SCOPE. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But moving on, the main improvements needed are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarify ESCALATION criteria with more examples, including scenarios like legal name changes causing verification issues, account access from abroad, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Emphasize that ESCALATION takes precedence over other categories if any security risk is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expand IN_SCOPE examples to include financial planning inquiries related to account services.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarify the difference between AUTHENTICATION_SETUP (setting up features) and issues during transactions (which might be TRANSACTION_STATUS or IN_SCOPE).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised prompt should:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add more examples to ESCALATION, such as \"I can't access my account after a legal name change\" or \"My account shows activity in another country while I'm home\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. State that ESCALATION should be chosen if any part of the inquiry involves immediate security risks, even if other categories are mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Expand IN_SCOPE examples to include financial advice related to account services (e.g., \"Should I add an authorized user?\" or \"What's the status of my IRA conversion request?\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Clarify that AUTHENTICATION_SETUP is for setting up security features, not for issues encountered during transactions that require authentication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the current prompt's explanation requirement says to consider urgency or security factors for ESCALATION. Maybe make that more explicit in the category definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the ESCALATION category, add a note: \"Prioritize this category if any part of the inquiry indicates immediate security threats or urgent access needs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, in the IN_SCOPE category, clarify that it includes service requests even if they involve financial planning or account-related advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: case 10's ground truth is ESCALATION. The user is asking about an old account from 15 years ago. The model thought it's IN_SCOPE. The current ESCALATION examples don't include old accounts. So adding an example like \"Inquiries about dormant accounts or old statements\" under ESCALATION might help.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why is that ESCALATION? Maybe because accessing old accounts could be a security risk, or it's considered out of normal service. The current OUT_OF_SCOPE is for unrelated topics. So perhaps the model needs to recognize that old accounts are a special case requiring escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the ground truth for case 10 is incorrect, but assuming it's correct, the prompt should include examples of old accounts under ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised ESCALATION examples could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Unauthorized access to my account while traveling abroad\"\n",
      "- \"Account lockouts or multiple failed login attempts\"\n",
      "- \"Large unexplained discrepancies in account balance\"\n",
      "- \"Inquiries about dormant accounts or old statements (e.g., 15 years ago)\"\n",
      "- \"Verification failures after legal name changes or other identity-related issues\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This would help the model recognize case 10 and case 14 as ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the IN_SCOPE category, adding examples like \"Financial planning advice related to account services (e.g., IRA conversion, investment options)\" would help with case 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point: case 3 was misclassified as TRANSACTION_STATUS. The user asked about application status. The current TRANSACTION_STATUS is for pending transactions. The model might have confused application status with transaction status. So the prompt should clarify that application status is IN_SCOPE, not TRANSACTION_STATUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in the TRANSACTION_STATUS category, the example is \"questions about pending transactions\". The user's inquiry about application status is a service request (IN_SCOPE), so the model needs to differentiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, adding a note in TRANSACTION_STATUS that it's specifically for financial transactions, not application statuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key improvements are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expand ESCALATION examples to cover more security scenarios.\n",
      "- Clarify that ESCALATION takes priority over other categories.\n",
      "- Expand IN_SCOPE examples to include financial planning related to accounts.\n",
      "- Differentiate TRANSACTION_STATUS from application status.\n",
      "- Clarify AUTHENTICATION_SETUP vs. transaction issues.\n",

      "   - **Case 10**: Predicted `IN_SCOPE` (old account inquiry) → Should be `ESCALATION`.\n",
      "   - **Case 14**: Predicted `CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE` (verification failure + name change) → Should be `ESCALATION`.\n",
      "   - **Case 18**: Predicted `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP` (wire transfer error) → Should be `IN_SCOPE`.\n",
      "   - **Case 22**: Predicted `ESCALATION` (fee dispute + lockout) → Ground truth `IN_SCOPE` (possible ground truth error, but model over-escalated).\n",
      "   - **Case 24**: Predicted `ESCALATION` (credit score drop) → Should be `IN_SCOPE`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Root Cause Investigation:**\n",
      "- **Escalation Ambiguity**: The prompt lacks clarity on security risks like legal name changes (Case 14) or dormant account inquiries (Case 10).\n",
      "- **IN_SCOPE Boundaries**: Financial advice (Case 9) or non-transaction service requests (Case 18) are misclassified due to insufficient examples.\n",

      "First, I need to identify the error patterns. Looking at the evaluation results, there are 6 cases where the prediction was wrong. For example, case 1 was classified as ESCALATION instead of PIN_RESET. The explanation there mentions security risks due to informal language and combining requests. But the ground truth is PIN_RESET, so maybe the model over-escalated here.\n",

The explanation says it's urgent and might be a security issue, but maybe the model is too aggressive in escalating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 21 involves updating contact info and being locked out. The model called it ESCALATION (correct), but the ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. Wait, the ground truth here is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE, but the user is also locked out. The note says if any part involves security risks or urgent access, classify as ESCALATION. So maybe the ground truth is wrong here, but according to the current rules, the model's prediction is correct. Wait, but the case is marked as task_succeed: false, meaning the model's prediction was wrong. Hmm, maybe the ground truth is incorrect, but we have to take it as given. So the model's error here is classifying as ESCALATION when the ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. But according to the note, the lockout should trigger ESCALATION. So maybe the ground truth is wrong, but the model followed the note. But the evaluation says the model's prediction is wrong. So perhaps the note is causing over-escalation.\n",

      "Case 22: Unrecognized fee and account lockout. Model says ESCALATION, ground truth IN_SCOPE. The explanation mentions potential fraud and lockout, which should be ESCALATION. So maybe the ground truth is wrong here, but according to the note, it should be ESCALATION. But the case is marked as a failure. So perhaps the model is correct, but the ground truth is wrong. But the user's instruction says to focus on the explanation and critique incorrect explanations.\n",

But according to the categories, PIN_RESET is a separate category. The note says if any part involves security risks, escalate. But changing PIN is a standard request. Maybe the model is misinterpreting the combination of requests as a security risk.\n",

So the model is correct here, but the ground truth is wrong. But according to the evaluation, the model's prediction is wrong. So maybe the note is causing confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 22: Unrecognized fee and lockout. The model escalated, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The explanation says potential fraud and lockout, which should be ESCALATION. So maybe the ground truth is wrong here. But the case is marked as a failure. So perhaps the model is correct, but the ground truth is incorrect. But the user's instruction says to focus on the explanation part and critique incorrect explanations with respect to the ground truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main problem is that the model is over-escalating in some cases where the ground truth is another category. The note in the current template says to escalate if any part involves security risks or urgent access. But maybe the examples in the categories are not clear enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current template's ESCALATION examples: immediate threats like fraudulent activity abroad, account lockouts, large discrepancies, etc. But in case 1, the user is changing PIN and updating contact info. The model thought the combination and informal language indicated a security risk. But maybe the model is misinterpreting the urgency or security aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue is the overlap between ESCALATION and other categories. For example, CARD_DISPUTE is for unauthorized charges, but if there's a security risk (like traveling abroad), it's ESCALATION. But the model might not be distinguishing between isolated charges and those with security implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case 1, the user's request is about PIN reset and contact info. The model escalated because of security risks. But according to the categories, PIN_RESET is a separate category. So the model is incorrectly applying the escalation note. The note says \"if any part involves security risks or urgent access needs, classify as ESCALATION.\" But changing PIN is a standard request unless there's a security breach. The user's inquiry doesn't mention a breach, just wants to change PIN and update contact info. So maybe the model is overreacting here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the problem is that the note is too broad. The model is escalating even when the primary request is a standard one (like PIN reset) but combined with another request. The note might need to be more specific about what constitutes a security risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: case 21. The user is updating contact info and is locked out. The model escalated, which according to the note (account lockout is escalation) is correct. But the ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. So maybe the ground truth is wrong here, but according to the current note, the model is correct. But the evaluation says the model's prediction is wrong. So perhaps the note is causing over-escalation when the primary request is a contact update but there's a lockout. The model should escalate here, but the ground truth says otherwise. So maybe the ground truth is incorrect, but the user's instruction says to take the ground truth as correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the case 21's ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. The user's inquiry is about updating contact info and being locked out. The model's explanation says it's critical for security and there's a lockout, so escalation. But the ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. So the model is wrong here. So why? Because the primary request is contact info update, but the lockout is part of it. The note says if any part involves urgent access, escalate. So the model is following the note, but the ground truth is different. So maybe the note is causing over-escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the root cause is that the note is too broad, leading the model to escalate even when the primary request is a standard one but there's a secondary security issue. The model might need to prioritize the primary intent unless there's a clear security threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue is case 18: user can't complete wire transfer due to verification errors. The model labeled ESCALATION, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The explanation says it's urgent and might be a security issue. But wire transfer issues are part of IN_SCOPE (account-related service requests). So the model is incorrectly escalating here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the model is escalating when there's a service request with a verification error. The note says to escalate for security risks or urgent access. But maybe the model is misinterpreting verification errors as security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the problem areas are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Over-escalation due to the note's broadness.\n",
      "- Confusion between ESCALATION and other categories like IN_SCOPE or CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE.\n",
      "- Ambiguous boundaries between categories, especially when multiple issues are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this, the prompt needs to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clarify when to escalate vs. when to use other categories.\n",
      "2. Provide more specific examples of what constitutes a security risk or urgent access.\n",
      "3. Adjust the note to prevent over-escalation for standard requests with minor security aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Modify the ESCALATION category to specify that it's for immediate threats or severe security breaches, not routine requests with security elements.\n",
      "- Add examples to other categories that include security-related aspects but are not escalations.\n",
      "- Adjust the note to say escalate only if the primary concern is a security threat or urgent access, not when it's a secondary part of a standard request.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in case 1, the primary request is PIN reset and contact update. Unless there's a breach mentioned, it's not escalation. So the note should be more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: case 21's ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. The user is locked out, which is urgent. But the primary request is contact update. So maybe the model should prioritize the primary intent unless there's a clear security threat. But according to the current note, any urgent access (like lockout) requires escalation. So the model is correct, but the ground truth is wrong. But the evaluation says the model is wrong. So perhaps the ground truth is incorrect, but we have to work with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the model is misapplying the note. The note says \"if any part involves security risks or urgent access needs, classify as ESCALATION.\" So even if the primary request is contact update, but there's a lockout (urgent access), it should escalate. But the ground truth says CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. So this is a conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests that the note is causing over-escalation. So the note needs to be refined. Maybe the note should say escalate only if the primary concern is security or urgent access, not when it's part of another request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the categories need better examples. For example, CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE examples could include scenarios where there's a lockout, but if the primary request is contact update, it's still CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. But that contradicts the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. So the current note is leading to escalation in cases where the primary request is another category but there's a security aspect. To prevent this, the note should be adjusted to prioritize the primary intent unless there's a clear security threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "So possible changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Modify the note to say: \"Classify as ESCALATION only if the primary concern is a security breach, immediate threat, or urgent access need. If the inquiry includes security elements but the main request is another category (e.g., PIN reset), use the appropriate category unless there's a clear security threat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, adjust the ESCALATION examples to be more specific and the note to emphasize that escalation is for severe cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach: split the note into two parts. First, check if the primary request is a standard category. Then, check if there's a security risk or urgent access. If both, escalate. But that's not clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, in the ESCALATION category, add examples that are clearly severe, and in other categories, add examples that include security elements but are not escalations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in PIN_RESET, add an example where the user also mentions wanting to update contact info, but no security breach is mentioned. Then, it's PIN_RESET.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current template, the ESCALATION examples include \"Fraudulent activity abroad,\" \"Account lockouts,\" etc. But case 21's ground truth is CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE even though there's a lockout. So maybe the ground truth is wrong, but according to the evaluation, the model is wrong. So perhaps the model is following the note incorrectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the model is misapplying the note. The note says to escalate if any part involves security risks. So even if the primary request is contact update, but there's a lockout (security risk), escalate. But the ground truth says CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. So this suggests that the note is causing over-escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the note needs to be adjusted. Maybe the note should say: \"Escalate only if the primary issue is a security threat or urgent access. If the inquiry includes security elements but the main request is another category, use the main category unless there's a clear security breach.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to phrase that in the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: the current note is too broad. The model is escalating even when the security aspect is not the main concern. So the note should emphasize that escalation is for primary security threats, not secondary ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "So possible changes to the note:\n",
      "\n",
      "Original note: \"If any part of the inquiry involves security risks or urgent access needs, classify as ESCALATION.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Revised note: \"Classify as ESCALATION only if the primary concern is a security breach, immediate threat, or urgent access need. For standard requests with minor security elements (e.g., updating contact info while mentioning a PIN reset), use the appropriate category unless there's a clear security threat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's a bit long. Alternatively, adjust the ESCALATION examples to be more severe and add examples to other categories that include security elements but are not escalations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE category, add an example: \"Need to update address and phone number. Also, having trouble logging in.\" → Still CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE unless there's a clear security breach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current examples don't cover that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: in the PIN_RESET category, add an example where the user also wants to update contact info: \"Change my PIN and update my email.\" → PIN_RESET.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current template, the ESCALATION examples are all severe. So maybe the model is over-interpreting the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main issues are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The note is too broad, leading to over-escalation.\n",
      "2. Ambiguous boundaries between ESCALATION and other categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this, the prompt should:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarify that ESCALATION is for primary security threats or urgent access, not secondary elements.\n",

      "\n",
      "Another idea: in the ESCALATION examples, include scenarios where the primary issue is security, and in other categories, include examples where security is a secondary concern.\n",

      "\n",
      "In ESCALATION: \"My account was accessed from another country and I can't log in.\" → ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the current template's ESCALATION examples are all severe. The model might be applying the note too broadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the key is to adjust the note and examples to prevent over-escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another error: case 18's ground truth is IN_SCOPE (wire transfer error), but model says ESCALATION. The explanation says it's urgent and might be security. But wire transfer issues are part of IN_SCOPE. So the model is incorrectly escalating here.\n",

      "So the model is escalating service requests with errors. The note says to escalate for urgent access, but maybe the model is misinterpreting \"verification required\" as a security issue.\n",

      "So the model is misclassifying transactional authentication issues as ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the AUTHENTICATION_SETUP category's note says \"Excludes authentication failures during transactions.\" So case 18's error during wire transfer is a transaction failure, so it's not AUTHENTICATION_SETUP. But the model labeled it ESCALATION. So why?\n",

      "The model's explanation says it's urgent and might be a security issue. But according to the categories, transaction errors are IN_SCOPE.\n",

      "**Analysis and Prompt Improvement Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Error Pattern Analysis:\n",
      "Misclassified cases (6 errors) primarily stem from over-escalation and boundary confusion between categories. Key issues:\n",
      "1. **Over-escalation**: Model incorrectly prioritizes ESCALATION for standard requests with minor security elements (e.g., PIN reset + contact update).\n",
      "2. **Boundary Ambiguity**: Confusion between transactional errors (IN_SCOPE) and security threats (ESCALATION).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Root Cause Investigation:\n",
      "- **Broad Escalation Note**: The instruction \"classify as ESCALATION if any part involves security risks\" leads to over-escalation for non-primary security concerns.\n",
      "- **Insufficient Examples**: Lack of examples distinguishing routine security-related requests (e.g., PIN reset with contact update) from true threats.\n",
      "- **Category Overlap**: Unclear separation between transactional authentication issues (IN_SCOPE) and security breaches (ESCALATION).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prompt Improvement Ideas:\n",
      "1. **Refine ESCALATION Criteria**:\n",
      "   - Specify that ESCALATION is reserved for **primary security threats** or **urgent access needs**, not secondary security elements.\n",
      "   - Example update:  \n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     \"ESCALATION\": \"For immediate threats (e.g., 'Fraudulent activity abroad,' 'Account lockouts'). Do not escalate standard requests with minor security mentions (e.g., 'Reset PIN and update contact info') unless a breach is explicitly stated.\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance Category Examples**:\n",
      "   - Add examples to non-ESCALATION categories that include security elements but lack urgency:  \n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     \"PIN_RESET\": \"For PIN changes, even if paired with non-urgent requests (e.g., 'Change PIN and update phone number').\",\n",
      "     \"CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE\": \"For address/phone updates, unless paired with explicit security breaches (e.g., 'Update info; also locked out due to fraud').\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarify Transactional Errors**:\n",
      "   - Explicitly state transactional failures (e.g., wire transfer errors) are IN_SCOPE unless tied to security risks:  \n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     \"IN_SCOPE\": \"For service requests (e.g., 'Wire transfer errors,' 'Fee disputes') unless accompanied by security threats.\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Adjust Escalation Note**:\n",
      "   - Reword to prioritize primary intent:  \n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     \"Note: Use ESCALATION only if the core issue is a security breach or urgent access. For requests with secondary security elements (e.g., 'Update contact info and reset PIN'), default to the primary category unless a threat is clear.\"\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Structure Improvements**:\n",
      "   - Group categories by urgency to reinforce hierarchy (ESCALATION first, followed by security-adjacent categories).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revised Template Snippet:\n",
      "```json\n",
      "\"ESCALATION\": \"For primary security threats (e.g., 'Unauthorized access abroad,' 'Account lockouts'). Exclude routine requests with security mentions unless a breach is confirmed.\",\n",
      "\"PIN_RESET\": \"For PIN changes, including when paired with non-security requests (e.g., 'Reset PIN and update email').\",\n",
      "\"IN_SCOPE\": \"For service requests (e.g., 'Transaction errors,' 'Fee disputes') unless tied to active security risks.\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Fixes**:\n",
      "- Prevent over-escalation by narrowing ESCALATION to primary threats.\n",

      "\n",
      "Case 3: User asked about application status. Prediction was OUT_OF_SCOPE, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The explanation says it's not related to transactions, but maybe the model confused application status with service requests. The current IN_SCOPE says \"service requests (e.g., transaction errors, fee disputes)\" but maybe application status isn't covered here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 9: IRA conversion advice. Predicted OUT_OF_SCOPE, ground truth IN_SCOPE. The explanation says it's financial planning, which the current IN_SCOPE might not include. The existing IN_SCOPE examples don't cover financial advice, so the model might not see it as in-scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 10: Old account inquiry. Predicted IN_SCOPE, ground truth ESCALATION. The user is checking a 15-year-old account. The current ESCALATION mentions primary security threats, but maybe dormant accounts are considered a security risk. The model didn't escalate because there's no explicit breach mentioned, but the age of the account might be a factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 14: Email update with verification failure. Predicted CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE, ground truth ESCALATION. The user mentions a legal name change and verification failure. The current ESCALATION note says to exclude routine requests unless a breach is confirmed. Maybe the name change and verification failure together are a security risk, but the model didn't catch that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 15: Portfolio loss complaint. Predicted IN_SCOPE, ground truth ESCALATION. The user wants to speak to a manager immediately. The explanation says it's a service complaint, but maybe the urgency (\"speak to manager immediately\") should trigger escalation. The current ESCALATION might not cover urgent service issues unless they're security-related.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 22: Unrecognized fee and lockout. Predicted ESCALATION, ground truth IN_SCOPE. The model escalated because of the lockout, but maybe the ground truth considers it a fee dispute. The explanation says both fee and lockout, so maybe the model over-escalated here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 23: Mortgage documentation request. Predicted OUT_OF_SCOPE, ground truth IN_SCOPE. The user needs documentation for a mortgage. The current IN_SCOPE might not include such requests, leading to misclassification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the error patterns, the main issues are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Over-escalation (Case 22) where the model escalates when maybe it's a service request.\n",
      "2. Under-escalation (Cases 10, 14, 15) where security risks or urgent issues aren't recognized.\n",
      "3. IN_SCOPE boundaries not covering financial advice (Case 9) or application status (Case 3).\n",

      "The current prompt's ESCALATION note says to use it only if the core issue is a security breach or urgent access. But maybe the examples need to clarify what constitutes urgency beyond security. For example, Case 15's urgency (speak to manager) might not be considered a security threat but still requires escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IN_SCOPE category might need more examples. The current examples are transaction errors and fee disputes. Adding examples like application status checks, financial planning advice, or documentation requests could help.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Case 10, the 15-year-old account inquiry might be a security risk (dormant account), so the ESCALATION examples should include such scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 14's legal name change and verification failure might be a security risk, so the ESCALATION criteria should mention identity verification issues post-legal changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE category says to exclude if paired with explicit breaches. But maybe the model didn't see the verification failure as a breach. The prompt might need to clarify that verification failures after legal changes are security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The note in the current template says to use ESCALATION only if the core issue is a security breach or urgent access. But \"urgent access\" might need examples. For example, needing funds for an emergency trip (Case 6 was correct, but maybe other urgent cases like Case 15's manager request are not covered).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, suggestions would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expand ESCALATION examples to include dormant account inquiries (>5 years), identity verification failures after legal changes, and urgent service requests requiring immediate manager intervention.\n",
      "- Clarify IN_SCOPE to include application status checks, financial planning advice related to accounts, and documentation requests.\n",
      "- Adjust the note to emphasize that any urgent access need (even non-security) might require escalation, but perhaps that's conflicting. Wait, the current note says ESCALATION for urgent access. Maybe the model didn't see Case 15 as urgent access. So perhaps the examples need to include urgent service issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the current ESCALATION examples don't cover all scenarios. Adding examples like \"Inquiring about a 15-year-old account\" under ESCALATION would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue: The current IN_SCOPE examples are limited. Adding more examples like \"Request for account statements for mortgage\" (Case 23) would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE category's exclusion for explicit breaches might need clarification. For example, if the user says they can't update because of a lockout, that's a security issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current prompt, the note says to default to primary category unless a threat is clear. Maybe the model needs more guidance on what constitutes a \"clear threat\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the key improvements would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clarify ESCALATION criteria with more examples, including dormant accounts, identity verification issues, and urgent service needs (like manager requests).\n",
      "2. Expand IN_SCOPE examples to cover application status, financial advice, documentation requests.\n",
      "3. Adjust the note to emphasize that any urgent access or security risk (even if secondary) should trigger escalation if it's a primary concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the note says \"use ESCALATION only if the core issue is a security breach or urgent access\". So maybe the model is not recognizing certain urgent issues as escalations. For example, Case 15's manager request is urgent but not a security breach. So perhaps the ESCALATION category should include urgent service issues even if not security-related. But the current note says \"urgent access\" which might be interpreted as access-related. So maybe the note needs to be expanded to include urgent service requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the model is misclassifying because the examples don't cover those scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: The current ESCALATION examples are about security threats. The note says to exclude routine requests unless a breach is confirmed. But in Case 14, the verification failure after a name change might be a breach. So the examples should include identity verification issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised ESCALATION examples could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unauthorized access abroad\n",
      "- Account lockouts\n",
      "- Large discrepancies in balance\n",
      "- Verification failures after legal name changes\n",
      "- Inquiries about dormant accounts (>5 years)\n",
      "- Urgent service requests requiring immediate attention (e.g., \"Need to speak to manager immediately about a critical issue\")\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current note says ESCALATION is for security threats or urgent access. So maybe the urgent service requests need to be part of ESCALATION if they're critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Case 15, the user wants to speak to a manager immediately about a portfolio loss. The model classified it as IN_SCOPE, but ground truth is ESCALATION. So the model didn't see the urgency as requiring escalation. So the ESCALATION criteria need to include urgent service issues even if not security-related.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current note says ESCALATION is for security breaches or urgent access. So maybe \"urgent access\" is too narrow. The note might need to be rephrased to include urgent service requests that require immediate escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the model might need more examples where urgency (non-security) leads to escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the main points for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expand ESCALATION examples to include non-security urgent issues (like manager requests) and identity verification problems.\n",
      "- Clarify IN_SCOPE to include more service requests like application status, financial advice, documentation.\n",
      "- Adjust the note to prioritize escalation for any urgent service request or security risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current note: \"Use ESCALATION only if the core issue is a security breach or urgent access. For requests with secondary security elements, default to primary unless threat is clear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the note should be adjusted to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Use ESCALATION for primary security threats (e.g., unauthorized access, account lockouts) or urgent service requests requiring immediate attention (e.g., 'Need to speak to manager now'). For requests with secondary security elements, escalate only if a breach is confirmed or urgency is critical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But that might complicate. Alternatively, add examples to ESCALATION that include urgent service issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue: The current IN_SCOPE examples don't cover application status (Case 3). So adding \"application status inquiries\" to IN_SCOPE examples would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Case 9, IRA conversion advice is considered IN_SCOPE. So the IN_SCOPE should include financial planning related to accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised IN_SCOPE could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For service requests (e.g., transaction errors, fee disputes, application status checks, financial planning advice related to accounts).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the TRANSACTION_STATUS category is for pending financial transactions. Case 3's application status is not a transaction, so the model correctly classified it as OUT_OF_SCOPE, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. Wait, no: the model predicted OUT_OF_SCOPE, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. So the model was wrong here. So the current IN_SCOPE needs to include application status. So adding that example would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the steps for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add examples to ESCALATION for dormant account inquiries, identity verification failures, and urgent service requests (like manager escalation).\n",
      "2. Expand IN_SCOPE examples to include application status, financial advice, documentation requests.\n",
      "3. Clarify the note to emphasize that any urgent service request (even non-security) should be escalated if critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current note says ESCALATION is for security breaches or urgent access. So maybe the model isn't considering urgent service requests as escalations unless they're access-related. So perhaps the note needs to be adjusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the model's error in Case 15 is because the explanation says it's a service complaint, but the ground truth is ESCALATION. So the model didn't recognize the urgency (\"speak to manager immediately\") as requiring escalation. So the ESCALATION criteria need to include urgent service issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, adding to ESCALATION examples: \"Urgent service requests requiring immediate manager intervention (e.g., 'I need to speak to a manager now about a critical issue').\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: Case 10's 15-year-old account. The model didn't escalate because there's no explicit breach, but maybe dormant accounts are a security risk. So adding \"Inquiries about dormant accounts (>5 years old)\" to ESCALATION examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Case 14, the verification failure after a name change. The model classified as CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE. So the ESCALATION should include identity verification issues. So adding \"Verification failures after legal name changes\" to ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised ESCALATION examples would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "ESCALATION - For primary security threats (e.g., 'Unauthorized access abroad,' 'Account lockouts,' 'Large discrepancies,' 'Verification failures after legal name changes,' 'Inquiries about dormant accounts >5 years,' 'Urgent service requests requiring immediate attention').\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the note could be adjusted to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Note: Use ESCALATION for confirmed security breaches, urgent access needs, or critical service issues requiring immediate attention. For secondary security mentions (e.g., 'Reset PIN and update info'), default to primary category unless threat is confirmed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current note says \"use ESCALATION only if core issue is security breach or urgent access\". So maybe the model is not considering urgent service issues as escalations unless they're access-related. So the note needs to clarify that urgent service requests (like manager escalation) are part of escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the model's error in Case 15 is due to not recognizing the urgency. So the ESCALATION criteria need to include urgent service requests even if not security-related.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the key changes are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expand ESCALATION examples to include urgent service requests and identity verification issues.\n",
      "- Clarify IN_SCOPE to include more service requests.\n",
      "- Adjust the note to emphasize escalation for urgent service issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point: The current CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE says to exclude if paired with explicit breaches. But in Case 14, the verification failure might be considered a breach. So the model didn't escalate because it's a secondary element. But the note says to escalate only if threat is clear. So maybe the examples need to show that verification failures are breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, adding to ESCALATION examples: \"Verification failures after legal changes (e.g., 'Can't update email after name change and verification failed').\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the current template, the ESCALATION examples don't cover that. So adding such examples would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final suggestions would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add examples to ESCALATION for dormant accounts, identity verification failures, and urgent service requests.\n",
      "2. Expand IN_SCOPE examples to include application status, financial advice, documentation.\n",
      "3. Clarify the note to include urgent service requests in escalation criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the current structure might need better organization. For example, grouping categories by urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another possible issue: The current ESCALATION note says \"exclude routine requests with security mentions unless a breach is confirmed\". But maybe the model isn't recognizing certain breaches. So the examples need to be more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised ESCALATION section could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "ESCALATION - For confirmed security breaches (e.g., 'Unauthorized access abroad,' 'Account lockouts,' 'Verification failures after legal name changes,' 'Inquiries about dormant accounts >5 years'), large unexplained discrepancies, or urgent service requests requiring immediate attention (e.g., 'Need to speak to manager immediately').\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the note could be adjusted to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Note: Prioritize ESCALATION for any confirmed security threats, urgent access issues, or critical service requests. For secondary security mentions (e.g., 'Reset PIN and update contact info'), use primary category unless a breach is explicitly stated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, urgent service requests are included in escalation criteria.\n",

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to analyze the classification performance based on the given evaluation results and suggest prompt improvements. The current template has some issues leading to misclassifications, especially in cases 18 and 22.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to look at the misclassified cases. From the evaluation results, cases 18 and 22 were predicted as ESCALATION but the ground truth was IN_SCOPE and IN_SCOPE respectively. The explanations given in the predictions mention urgency or security issues, but the ground truth says otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at case 18: The user can't complete an international wire transfer due to a verification error. The model escalated it because of the urgent need (son abroad needing funds) and possible security issue. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The current prompt's note says to use ESCALATION for primary security threats or urgent access. Maybe the model is over-escalating here because the verification error isn't a confirmed breach. The prompt might need to clarify that transactional errors without confirmed security issues are IN_SCOPE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 22: Unrecognized charge and account lockout. The model escalated it, but ground truth is IN_SCOPE. The current ESCALATION category includes account lockouts. Wait, the current template's ESCALATION does mention account lockouts. Hmm, maybe the model is correct here, but the ground truth is wrong? Or perhaps the explanation in the prompt's note isn't clear. The note says \"use ESCALATION for primary security threats... unless a breach is confirmed.\" But account lockout could be a security threat. Maybe the ground truth is incorrect, but assuming it's correct, the model is over-escalating. The prompt might need to specify that lockouts due to failed disputes (like fee disputes) are IN_SCOPE unless there's a confirmed breach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current prompt's ESCALATION examples: includes account lockouts. So case 22's lockout should be ESCALATION. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. That's conflicting. Maybe the ground truth is wrong here, but the user says to focus on the explanation. The model's explanation for case 22 says it's a potential security breach and urgent need. The current prompt's ESCALATION includes account lockouts, so the model is following that. But the ground truth says IN_SCOPE. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth, but the user wants us to critique the explanation. The model's explanation is correct per the current prompt, but the ground truth is different. So maybe the prompt's ESCALATION criteria are too broad, leading to over-escalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current note says \"use ESCALATION for primary security threats... secondary security mentions default to primary unless a breach is confirmed.\" So in case 22, the lockout is a primary security threat (account lockout is listed under ESCALATION), so the model is correct. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. That's a discrepancy. Maybe the ground truth is wrong, but the user's instruction says to focus on the explanation. So perhaps the model's explanation is correct, but the ground truth is incorrect. However, the user's task is to improve the prompt based on the evaluation results. So maybe the prompt's ESCALATION criteria need to be more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current ESCALATION examples: account lockouts are included. So case 22's prediction is correct. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. That's conflicting. Maybe the ground truth is wrong, but the user's example shows it as a misclassification. So perhaps the model is over-escalating. Therefore, the prompt's ESCALATION criteria might need to be narrowed. For example, account lockouts might not always be ESCALATION unless paired with other factors. But the current template includes account lockouts in ESCALATION. So maybe the model is correct, but the ground truth is wrong. However, the user's evaluation says it's a misclassification, so the model's prediction is wrong. Therefore, the prompt's ESCALATION criteria are too broad.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case 18, the user has a wire transfer error and urgent need. The model escalated it. The current prompt's ESCALATION includes urgent service requests. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. So the model is over-escalating. The prompt's note says \"urgent service requests requiring immediate intervention\" should be ESCALATION. But maybe the wire transfer error is a service request (IN_SCOPE) unless there's a security breach. The model's explanation mentions a potential security issue (verification required error), but the user didn't confirm a breach. So the model is escalating based on the error and urgency. The current prompt's ESCALATION includes \"urgent service requests requiring immediate intervention,\" but maybe the criteria need to be more specific. For example, only escalate if there's a confirmed security threat or critical access issue, not just transactional errors with urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main issues are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Over-escalation in cases where there's urgency but no confirmed security breach (case 18).\n",
      "2. Possible confusion between transactional errors (IN_SCOPE) and security threats (ESCALATION).\n",
      "\n",
      "The current prompt's ESCALATION includes \"urgent service requests requiring immediate intervention,\" but maybe that's too vague.

So perhaps the examples and criteria need to be more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the current ESCALATION examples: \"Speak to manager immediately about critical issue\" is an example. But case 18's user wants to send emergency funds, which is urgent but not a security breach. The model escalated it because of the verification error (possible security) and urgency. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. So the model is incorrectly applying the ESCALATION criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current note says \"use ESCALATION for primary security threats, urgent access needs, or critical service issues.\" The model might be interpreting \"critical service issues\" as any urgent request. But the examples under ESCALATION are more about security or access. So the note's wording might be causing confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarify that ESCALATION is for confirmed security breaches, account lockouts, identity verification failures (like post-legal name change), dormant accounts (>5 years), or urgent access needs (e.g., can't access funds for emergency). But urgent service requests (like needing to send money) without security issues should be IN_SCOPE.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Adjust the examples in ESCALATION to remove ambiguous cases. For example, the current example \"Speak to manager immediately about critical issue\" is vague. Maybe replace it with more specific examples like \"Need access to funds for emergency surgery\" (if paired with a security issue) or \"Account frozen due to suspected fraud.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- Modify the note to emphasize that ESCALATION requires confirmed security threats or critical access issues, not just urgency. For example, \"Use ESCALATION for confirmed security breaches, urgent access needs (e.g., can't access funds for emergency travel), or critical service issues tied to security. Do not escalate for standard service requests with urgency unless a security threat is confirmed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In case 18, the user's issue is a wire transfer error and urgent need. The model escalated it because of the verification error (possible security) and urgency. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. So the model is incorrectly considering the verification error as a security threat. The current prompt's ESCALATION includes \"identity verification failures post-legal changes,\" but not general verification errors. So maybe the model is over-generalizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue: the current ESCALATION includes \"urgent service requests requiring immediate intervention.\" But case 18's request is urgent but not a security issue. So perhaps the criteria should be more specific. For example, urgent service requests only escalate if tied to security or access issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to fix case 18, the prompt should clarify that transactional errors (like wire transfer issues) are IN_SCOPE unless there's a confirmed security breach. The model's explanation for case 18 says \"potential security issue,\" but the user didn't confirm it. So the model is escalating based on a possible security issue, but the ground truth says it's IN_SCOPE. Therefore, the prompt needs to specify that only confirmed breaches trigger ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, case 22: unrecognized charge and account lockout. The model escalated it because account lockout is in ESCALATION. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. Maybe the ground truth is wrong, but according to the current prompt, the model is correct. However, the user's evaluation says it's a misclassification. So perhaps the prompt's ESCALATION criteria for account lockouts need to be adjusted. Maybe account lockouts are only ESCALATION if paired with other security indicators. But the current template lists account lockouts under ESCALATION. So this is conflicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the current ESCALATION examples include \"Account lockouts.\" So case 22's prediction is correct. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. That suggests a possible error in the ground truth. However, the user's task is to improve the prompt based on the evaluation results. So perhaps the model is over-escalating here. Maybe the account lockout in case 22 is due to a fee dispute, which is a service request. The current prompt says ESCALATION includes account lockouts, but maybe the context matters. If the lockout is due to a fee dispute (a service issue), then it's IN_SCOPE. But the current ESCALATION includes account lockouts regardless of context. So the model is following the prompt, but the ground truth is different. This indicates that the prompt's ESCALATION criteria are too broad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the prompt should clarify that account lockouts are ESCALATION only if they are due to security breaches, not service-related issues. For example, if the account is locked due to multiple failed logins (security), escalate. If locked due to a fee dispute (service), then IN_SCOPE.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current ESCALATION examples don't specify the context of the account lockout. So the model can't differentiate. Hence, the examples need to be more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, possible improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In ESCALATION, specify that account lockouts are included only when due to security reasons (e.g., \"Account lockouts due to suspected fraud\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For case 22, the lockout is due to a fee dispute (unrecognized charge). So if the lockout is a result of a service issue (fee dispute), it's IN_SCOPE. But the current prompt's ESCALATION includes account lockouts without context. Therefore, the model is incorrectly escalating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the prompt's ESCALATION criteria need to be refined to include account lockouts only when tied to security threats, not service requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: the current note says \"use ESCALATION for primary security threats... secondary security mentions default to primary unless a breach is confirmed.\" In case 22, the fee dispute (IN_SCOPE) is paired with a lockout (ESCALATION). The model escalated it. But the ground truth is IN_SCOPE. So the model is prioritizing ESCALATION over the primary category. The note says secondary security mentions default to primary unless a breach is confirmed. But here, the primary category is a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE), and the secondary is a lockout (ESCALATION). The model is escalating because the lockout is a security threat. But according to the note, if the primary is not a breach, then default to primary. Wait, the note says \"secondary security mentions default to primary category unless a breach is confirmed.\" So if the primary is a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE) and the secondary is a lockout (security), but no breach is confirmed, then default to IN_SCOPE. But the model escalated. So the model is not following the note correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, here's the confusion. The note says: \"Secondary security mentions (e.g., 'Reset PIN + update info') default to the primary category unless a breach is confirmed.\" So if the primary is a service request (like fee dispute) and there's a security mention (lockout), but no confirmed breach, then it's IN_SCOPE. But the model escalated. So the model is not applying the note's rule. Therefore, the prompt's note needs to be clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case 22, the primary request is a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE), and the secondary is an account lockout. The model escalated because the lockout is a security threat. But according to the note, since the primary is not a breach, it should default to IN_SCOPE unless a breach is confirmed. But the model didn't do that. So the model is not following the note's instruction. Therefore, the note's wording might be ambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current note says: \"Secondary security mentions default to the primary category unless a breach is confirmed.\" So if the primary is a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE) and there's a security mention (lockout), but no breach is confirmed, then it's IN_SCOPE. But the model escalated. So the model is incorrectly prioritizing the security mention. Therefore, the note needs to be more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible rewording of the note: \"If the primary request is not a security breach (e.g., service requests), but includes a secondary security mention (e.g., 'Reset PIN + fee dispute'), classify as the primary category (e.g., IN_SCOPE) unless there is a confirmed security breach. Only escalate if the security threat is the primary concern or confirmed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This would clarify that in case 22, since the primary is a fee dispute (IN_SCOPE) and the lockout is secondary, but no breach is confirmed, it should be IN_SCOPE.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the model's error in case 22 is due to not following the note's rule. Therefore, the note needs to be clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue: the current ESCALATION examples include \"Account lockouts\" without context. So the model might be treating all lockouts as ESCALATION. But in case 22, the lockout is due to a fee dispute, which is a service issue. So the model is incorrectly categorizing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the ESCALATION examples should specify that account lockouts are included when due to security reasons, not service-related issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, revised ESCALATION examples could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Account lockouts due to suspected fraudulent activity\n",
      "- Unauthorized withdrawals while traveling\n",
      "- Identity verification failures after legal name changes\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, the model knows that lockouts due to service issues (like fee disputes) are not ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this all together, the main improvements needed are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clarify ESCALATION criteria to include account lockouts only when tied to security threats, not service issues.\n",
      "2. Adjust the note to explicitly state that secondary security mentions default to the primary category unless a breach is confirmed, and provide examples.\n",
      "3. Add examples to ESCALATION that specify the context (e.g., \"Account lockouts due to fraud\").\n",
      "4. Ensure that urgent service requests are only escalated if tied to security or access issues, not just urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised prompt should:\n",
      "\n",
      "- In ESCALATION, specify that account lockouts are included when due to security reasons (e.g., \"Account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts due to fraud\").\n",
      "- Modify the note to say: \"Use ESCALATION for confirmed security breaches, urgent access needs (e.g., can't access funds for emergency travel), or critical service issues tied to security. If the primary request is a service issue (e.g., fee dispute) with a secondary security mention (e.g., account lockout), classify as the primary category unless a breach is confirmed.\"\n",
      "- Add examples to IN_SCOPE for urgent service requests without security issues (e.g., \"Need to send emergency funds but wire transfer failed due to error\").\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, case 18 would be IN_SCOPE (wire transfer error, urgent but no security breach), and case 22 would be IN_SCOPE (fee dispute with lockout, but no confirmed breach).\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Issues Identified:\n",
      "1. **Over-escalation** in cases with urgency but no confirmed security breach (e.g., Case 18: wire transfer error with urgent need).\n",
      "2. **Misclassification of account lockouts** tied to service requests (e.g., Case 22: fee dispute + lockout) as ESCALATION instead of IN_SCOPE.\n",
      "3. **Ambiguity in urgency vs. security criteria** for ESCALATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Revisions:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Clarify ESCALATION Criteria**\n",
      "   - **Refine Security-Related Examples**: Specify context for account lockouts (e.g., fraud-related) to avoid over-escalation.\n",
      "   - **Narrow Urgency Requirements**: Limit escalation to security-critical or access-blocking issues, not general urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```json\n",
      "   \"ESCALATION\": \"For confirmed security breaches (e.g., 'Unauthorized withdrawals abroad,' 'Account lockouts due to fraud'), identity verification failures post-legal changes (e.g., 'Can't update email after name change'), dormant accounts (>5 years), or critical access issues (e.g., 'ATM retained card + urgent travel'). Exclude service requests with secondary security mentions unless a breach is confirmed.\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Strengthen Category Boundaries**\n",
      "   - **Expand IN_SCOPE Examples**: Include urgent service requests without security ties.\n",
      "   - **Differentiate Transactional Errors**: Clarify these are IN_SCOPE unless paired with confirmed breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```json\n",
      "   \"IN_SCOPE\": \"For service requests (e.g., 'Application status,' 'IRA advice,' 'Mortgage docs,' 'Fee disputes,' 'Wire transfer errors'). Urgent needs (e.g., 'Emergency funds') default here unless tied to security threats.\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Enhance Note for Hierarchy**\n",
      "   - **Explicitly Prioritize Primary Intent**: Clarify secondary security mentions do not override non-security primary requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```json\n",
      "   \"Note: Use ESCALATION only for confirmed breaches, critical access needs, or dormant accounts. Secondary security mentions (e.g., 'Reset PIN + fee dispute') default to the primary category (e.g., IN_SCOPE) unless a breach is explicitly stated.\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Structural Adjustments**\n",
      "   - **Reorder Examples**: Group by severity (ESCALATION first) and add bullet points for readability.\n",
      "   - **Remove Ambiguous Urgency Examples**: Replace vague cases like \"Speak to manager immediately\" with security-specific scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revised Template Snippet:\n",
      "```json\n",
      "\"ESCALATION\": \"For confirmed breaches (e.g., 'Fraudulent activity abroad,' 'Lockouts due to fraud'), identity failures post-legal changes, dormant accounts (>5 years), or critical access issues (e.g., 'ATM card retained + urgent travel').\",\n",
      "\"IN_SCOPE\": \"For service requests (e.g., 'Application status,' 'Financial advice,' 'Wire transfer errors,' 'Fee disputes'). Urgent needs default here unless security-critical.\",\n",
      "\"Note\": \"Prioritize ESCALATION for security threats. Secondary security mentions (e.g., 'PIN reset + update info') stay in primary category unless breach confirmed.\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Critical Fixes**:\n",
      "- Prevent over-escalation by tying urgency to security/access issues.\n",
      "- Clarify account lockouts require security context (e.g., fraud) to escalate.\n",
      "- Strengthen IN_SCOPE with non-security urgency examples.\n",
