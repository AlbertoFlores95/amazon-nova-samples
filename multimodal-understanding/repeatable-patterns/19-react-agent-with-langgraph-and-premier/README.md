## Overview

Amazon Bedrock Nova Premier is Amazon's advanced large language model (LLM) designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks and agentic applications. This sample code demonstrate how to leverage Nova Premier's capabilities with popular agent frameworks to build sophisticated AI solutions.

## Notebook

### Academic Paper Analysis with LangGraph ReAct Pattern

**Filename:** `01_ReAct_Agent_with_LangGraph.ipynb`

This notebook implements a LangGraph ReAct agent that can analyze academic papers (PDF files) using Amazon Nova Premier. The agent has specific tools to:

- Load and parse PDF documents
- Summarize papers
- Extract research questions
- Extract key results and findings
- Identify research gaps and future work

Key features:
- LangGraph implementation of the ReAct pattern
- PDF text extraction and section parsing
- Structured JSON outputs for research analysis
- Step-by-step reasoning

## Prerequisites

1. An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock
2. Amazon Bedrock model access enabled for Nova Premier (model ID: `us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0`)
3. Proper AWS credentials configured
4. Python 3.10+ with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed

## Setup

1. Configure AWS credentials with Amazon Bedrock access
   - Either through AWS CLI: `aws configure`
   - Or by setting environment variables
   - Or by using IAM roles (recommended for SageMaker environments)
