    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you will learn about the interactive mode of Nova Act and run your first workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer you use the Nova Act SDK to build your workflows. The SDK includes a function called `act()` which you use to pass prompts to Nova Act. Working with the Nova Act SDK in interactive mode is a great way to start learning about Nova Act and building workflows. It allows you to quickly iterate on your `act()` prompts by observing how those perform and then adjusting as needed. Once you have created a workflow that is working well, you can move the `act()` calls into a Python script and run the workflow in that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive mode is a great way to build Nova Act workflows as you can easily observe how Nova Act operates on a website for each prompt you provide. This enables you to easily adjust your prompts to ensure your Nova Act workflow is running reliably and consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steps below you will build a workflow that searches for coffee makers on amazon.com, and finds the cheapest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Start a Python shell environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the terminal type `python`\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python\n",

    "**2. Start a Nova Act session**\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, import the `NovaAct` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "from nova_act import NovaAct\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a Nova Act instance that points to `amazon.com` for its starting page. We do this by creating a `NovaAct` instance, passing in the website url via the required `starting_page` parameter which is the only required parameter. We will cover the other optional parameters throughout the workshop. We start the `NovaAct` session with `nova.start()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova = NovaAct(starting_page=\"https://amazon.com\")\n",
    "nova.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a Chrome browser launch and open to `amazon.com`. The first time you launch Nova Act it will take a few moments longer for the browser to launch as the underlying modules need to be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Write your first prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now you've got started your first Nova Act session. Let's ask Nova Act to search for coffee makers. We issue prompts to `NovaAct` via the `nova.act(\"<prompt goes here>\")` command. Let's issue the command by running the command below in our terminal. Note: please wait for the search to complete and do not adjust the window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova.act(\"search for coffee makers\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After a few moments you should see a search happening on the website, and the search results displayed. Congratulations, you just successfully completed your first Nova Act prompt!\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Understanding the prompt and response**\n",
    "\n",
    "So what just happened? Let's explore that.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a `nova.act()` call, the Nova Act SDK makes an inference call to the Nova Act AI model (running in the cloud). It passes to the inference call a screenshot of the current website, page metadata, and the prompt. This is why it is important to not adjust the window size as it can lead to inconsistent understanding during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inference response typically includes an action and screen coordinates, such as `agentClick(\" <box>757,561,812,718</box> \");` which the SDK then carries out on the website. This step of taking actions on the website is called the `actuation` step. Other actions include `agentType()` and `agentScroll()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the action to carry out, the inference response includes how the model thought about the request and how it arrived at its decision for the next step. This is contained with a `think()` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "During inference, the model may determine it needs to carry out multiple actions to complete the task, which would result in multiple `think()` elements. We can see all of this in our terminal for the prompt we just specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    ">>> nova.act(\"search for coffee makers\")\n",
    "eab1> act(\"search for coffee makers\")\n",
    "..............\n",
    "eab1> think(\"I am on the amazon homepage. My task is to search for coffee makers. I see a search field, but it is empty. I need to type 'coffee makers' into the search field.\");\n",
    ">> agentType(\"coffee makers\", \"<box>10,372,48,1062</box>\");\n",
    "......................\n",
    "eab1> think(\"The search field now contains 'coffee makers', so my last action was successful. The search has not been initiated. I see a search button to the right of the search field. I need to click the search button to initiate the search.\");\n",
    ">> agentClick(\"<box>10,1062,48,1110</box>\");\n",
    "....................\n",
    "eab1> think(\"I am now on the search results page for coffee makers, so my last action was successful. I have searched for coffee makers. The task is complete, and I need to simply return because no information was asked of me.\");\n",
    ">> return;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the `act()` call containing our prompt. We can also see how our one `act()` call resulted in two `think()` steps, each with an associated action; an `agentType()` for typing into the search field, and a `agentClick()` for clicking the search button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we didn't specifically say to `click the search bar`, but instead used a natural language instruction of `search for coffee makers`. When you prompt Nova Act, think of constructing your prompts using the same terminology you would use if you were asking a person to carry out those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Return a value from Nova Act**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try out more prompts by asking Nova Act to return the price of the first coffee maker.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova.act(\"return the price of the first item\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the output in the terminal. Note that if you are running this from a location where you are unable to purchase the item, you may not be able to see the price.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    ">>> result = nova.act(\"return the price of the first item\")\n",
    "be84> act(\"return the price of the first item\")\n",
    "................\n",
    "be84> think(\"I am on the search results page for coffee makers. My task is to return the price of the first item. The first item is not visible, it may be lower on the page. I should scroll down the page to reveal the first item.\");\n",
    ">> agentScroll(\"down\", \"<box>0,0,812,1600</box>\");\n",
    "..................\n",
    "be84> think(\"The page has scrolled down, and the results are now visible. Therefore, my last action was successful. I see the first item and its price is $99.99. The task is complete, and I need to return with the price of the first item.\");\n",
    ">> return \"$99.99\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we see Nova Act can extract and return information from a web page. In a later section you will learn how to structure the output returned from the page. Here we see a single `nova.act()` call resulted in a single `think()` step, compared to the two we saw in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Terminate an interactive session**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of the workshop you will run Nova Act within Python scripts. This allows us to more quickly write and run the Nova Act workflows. Let's go ahead and end our interactive session. Some handy commands to know:\n",
    "* *Control+X* - this terminates an active Nova Act instruction\n",
    "* *nova.stop()* - this terminates an active Nova Act instance\n",
    "* *Control+D* - this terminates the interactive Python session\n",

    "# Section 5: Prompting Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you will learn about best practices for prompting Nova Act. Nova Act is designed for enterprise use and scale, which means it is critical that workflows run reliabily and consistently over many runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Be concise**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb, a single `nova.act()` should comprise 3-5 actions (eg type, click). Keeping prompts concise enables scripts to run more reliably and consistently, whereas larger prompts can increase the variance in results as the number of actions increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, this prompt could work when you run it, but over many runs, there may be variability in the output.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova.act(\"Search for coffee makers then view the details of the first product and then add it to your cart\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, break this down into multiple prompts.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova.act(\"Search for coffee makers\")\n",
    "nova.act(\"View the details of the first product\")\n",
    "nova.act(\"Add it to your cart\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data formatting and filling out forms**\n",
    "\n",
    "When filling out a web form, you should explicitly instruct Nova Act on what data to input into each form element. This works well when you know the page structure ahead of time. However, there are cases where you may not know the page ahead of time, for example if you are creating one script to run on multiple sites. In those cases you can provide a data structure to Nova Act and ask it to populate the web form. Nova Act will use the field names and descriptions on the page to match to the input data it was provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, format the data in a conversational tone, just as you would if you were instructing another person to enter the data. So instead of using structured data formats like JSON or key values like `firstName: Bobby`, use a syntax like `The first name is Bobby.`. New lines are not included in the prompt so be sure to include proper punctuation to delineate inputs. Ending each line with a `.` (period) is a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we pass our input data into the Nova Act prompt, and assuming there are similarly labeled fields on the page, Nova Act will populate the page with this data.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "data = \"\"\"\n",
    "The first name is Bobby.\n",
    "The last name is McGee.\n",
    "The phone number is 555-555-5555.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "nova.act(f\"Fill out the form using this data: {data}\")\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Working with dates**`\n",
    "\n",
    "Date pickers are one of the more complex UI controls. It is recommended to specify the start and end dates in absolute time.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova.act(\"select dates march 23 to march 28\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Set the user agent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nova Act comes with Playwright's Chrome and Chromium browsers. These use the default User Agent set by Playwright. You can override this with the `user_agent` option:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nova = NovaAct(..., user_agent=\"MyUserAgent/2.7\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Build dynamic workflows with BOOL_SCHEMA**\n",
    "\n",
    "For many workflows, you may need Nova Act to first identify what actions it needs to carry out on the page, and then create prompts for those actions. This is helpful when you need to support multiple websites with a single Nova Act workflow. In a previous section you learned about the `BOOL_SCHEMA` constant. We can use this to understand the elements on a page, for example to learn `Is there a captcha on the screen?`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "result = nova.act(\"Is there a captcha on the screen?\", schema=BOOL_SCHEMA)\n",
    "if result.matches_schema and result.parsed_response:\n",
    "    input(\"Please solve the captcha and hit return when done\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can ask Nova Act to return all the form elements on a page and use that to drive the prompts. For example, by iterating over each element and creating a prompt for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "In this module you learned best practices for prompting Novav Act. In the next section you will learn about optimal screen resolutions."

    "# Section 6: Screen Resolution Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you will learn about optimal screen resolutions and best practices related to window sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Screen resolutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nova Act is optimized for screen resolutions between `864√ó1296` and `1536√ó2304`. Performance may degrade outside this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running Nova Act in `headless` mode, it launches a browser at a resolution of `1600x813`. When you are running Nova Act in `headed` mode (browser is visible), ensure that the screen resolution is capable of displaying `1600x813`. If not the `headed` browser will run in a lower resolution which can lead to inconsistencies in how the website is rendedered when running in `headless` mode. This is because many websites adjust their page and menu layouts based on the screen resolution, for example, collapsing menu items into a hamburger menu on lower resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see two examples of setting in different resolutions. In the first example, we set a lower resolution of `1536x864` and in the second a higher resolution of `1024√ó768`. Notice the difference in the page content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code for the lower resolution. Save it to a file named `low-res.py`.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "from nova_act import NovaAct\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    with NovaAct(starting_page=\"https://amazon.com\", screen_height= 864, screen_width=1536) as nova:\n",
    "        nova.act(\"search for pinatas\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Then run it with:\n",
    ":::code{language=\"sh\" showLineNumbers=false showCopyAction=true copyAutoReturn=false}\n",
    "python low-res.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a screen resolution like the following:\n",
    "![low-res](864x1536.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's run it in a higher resolution. (Note: your local machine's resolution will need to support `1920x1080` to see this example. If it can not, then you will need to adjust your resolution, or simply follow the code and observe the screenshot below). Save the code below to a file named `high-res.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from nova_act import NovaAct\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    with NovaAct(starting_page=\"https://amazon.com\", screen_height= 1080, screen_width=1920) as nova:\n",
    "        nova.act(\"search for pinatas\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then run it with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python high-res.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a screen resolution like the following:\n",
    "![high-res](./1080x1920.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the higher resolution screenshot contains more content than the lower resolution screenshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Adjusting window size during a workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Nova Act is running, **do not modify** the browser window size. Nova Act uses screenshots to help it understand the web site, and uses bounding boxes specified in screen coordinates to specify actions to take on the site. Adjusting the window size may confuse Nova Act as elements may become hidden or move around the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find you have adjusted the window size, simply stop the script, and then run it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Nova Act in `headless` mode which removes any possibility of accidentally interfering with the Nova Act browser window. See the later section on CAPTCHAs for tips on observing a `headless` browser,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "In this module you learned about best practices related to window size and screen resolution."
