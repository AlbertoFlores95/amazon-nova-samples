    "# Virtual Try-On: Basic Use\n",
    "\n",
    "All virtual try-on operations require three inputs (source image, reference image, mask) and produce 1 output (generated Image). The mask defines which area will be modified in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The area inside the mask: will be modified (“inpainted”) using the reference image as guide for what to fill\n",
    "- The area outside the mask: will be preserved as-is\n",
    "\n",
    "VTO provides three different masking modes via the `maskType` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`“GARMENT”` is an automatic masking mode in which a mask is generated on your behalf for an area of the body. When using the “GARMENT” mask type, you will also set a `garmentBasedMask.garmentClass` value to indicate which body area in the source image should be masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "`“PROMPT”` is another automatic masking mode, particularly useful for non-garment use cases like furniture and other products. When using the “PROMPT” mask type, you will set a `promptBasedMask.maskPrompt` value describing the area of the source image to be changed. This is identical to how the maskPrompt parameter of the Nova Canvas “INPAINTING” and “OUTPAINTING” task types work.\n",
    "\n",
    "`“IMAGE”` allows you to provide your own black and white image to be used as a mask, where black indicates the pixels of the source image to change and white indicates the pixels that should be unaffected. Use an image mask to add accessories to a person (handbag, jewlery, hat, etc.); to place products, logos, or other visual elements; or in garment scenarios where you want more control over styling of a garment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"GARMENT\" Mask Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the minimum configuration needed for a garment try-on scenario. The reference image can contain a garment on or off body. The model is intelligent enough to only transfer the garment(s) from the reference image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nova Canvas uses a black and white image mask to determine which part of the source image should be modified. Users can provide this image themselves, but the model also supports auto-masking modes that eliminate the need to provide your own mask image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll use a `maskType` of `\"GARMENT\"` which is one of the automatic masking modes. You simply indicate which type of garment you are trying to visualize via the `garmentClass` parameter, and Nova Canvas will take care of the rest. Refer the the [API Guide](https://quip-amazon.com/iwMyAbIqS8bS/2-Nova-Canvas-Refresh-Beta-API-Guide) for a full list of supported `garmentClass` values.\n",
